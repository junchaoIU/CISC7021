and the stories through rapture , for National Geographic picture of the world by Wade Davis celebrated explorers indigenous culture , these cultural diversity of extraordinary is at an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same sort of flexible rule . 
and we are now born to 母腹 生儿育女 in the world 
we have to go through the adult week sculpted by millennia . 
we have cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 lives that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture has a rhythm and dance songs of the unique identity . 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you send would now get a different way of thinking that you see the future . 
the culture of the world of unobtainable 犹如 五彩缤纷 mental life and culture web of life , covered the whole planet it had a very important 芸芸众生 of the Earth as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the web ecology . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , which is very strong , we as a species , the ability to look at the logo . 
as the erosion of the biosphere circles are facing the same race , again , the destruction of the end , and it faster . 
one of these is the most important sign language . 
we live in the original on this planet have 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s all of the spirit of the unique culture in this material actually 承 therapy in the world . 
each one of the language that &apos;s an ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that many people here in the audience with us in the same half of those languages , no longer to teach kids . 
in other words , that language has no 传人 effective rules act , unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last thing 本族语 lineage ancestors of people who have no way and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , is a terrible about every two weeks on the planet will be one of the 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop , give you a rough understand , and I let you personally feel are lose civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot as I said “ ” different way of living in front of it , I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 Northwest Bala Caesar pull 蚺 that they &apos;re called region of a political race because they believe that they were born in 米尔克 coming from the sacred river for the snake . 
it can &apos;t tell the difference between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 , so in their with no difference between the forest canopy 
and they say , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 异族 通婚 通婚 linguistics . a call to engage with people who &apos;ve got a different language . 
this is based on the history of mythology and you can see through a strange phenomenon , because of the wedding 异族 tend to have a very 六七种 language you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador 华拉尼 genocide is the most amazing people before the genocide in 1958 , one year , I used to that they had peace friendly . 
five year 1957 missionaries trying to approach them , but these people who made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air , and they &apos;ve eight to 十张 . we think this is kind of , but they didn &apos;t think about the people that live in water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they picked up from the forest on these pictures and images just flip through these people are trying to find the person , but they found nothing and they think it &apos;s called the Devil cards , so they use it with the five missionary 戮 died . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying external 戮 华拉尼 people die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population is tribals 戮 by their own . 
we investigate some 宗谱 一个八代 natural causes , we found only 两例 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the more old people go to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing 惊诧 forest perspective . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 smell urine , the animals , and they know what it is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand the secret I have to figure out what this mysterious religion voodoo taught how to teach isn &apos;t a voodoo the magic of darkness . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the most important in the world will give you some examples of religion . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about it was born with the connection between 
somehow living soul . 
the rhythm of the dance Outreach 大水 tap can replace temporary under the soul of the soul of the living in that short 侍僧成 shining moment for God . 
so voodoo believers , like to say you go to church worship to call God . 
to be divine in our cathedral . 
you &apos;ve been gods . how would you affix hurt ? 
when I was exposed to live in all of those groups of St. 玛尔塔 mountains in northern Columbia 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization they were once conquered and takes over the Columbia plain since the Caribbean in the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast in plain an isolated . 
the continent globe in this bloody this race to the people who have never been seen Spain . 
and to the monks along 续 today , they would rule institutions , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
they like to go back to the 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain around these values is the relationship between the believers with the universe , we can call it the ecology of balanced . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call themselves over lies call to say we are destroying the world . 
the ability to create this intuition is very important . 
it &apos;s not going to 多愁善感 Aboriginal people would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 it , it doesn &apos;t matter . 
this is important for meaning illustrates the relationship between people with nature . 
I grew up in the jungles of the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be logging in the woods . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this is a photo I took this past August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 俗称 斯卡藤 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often use it to make water -- dead cane psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent component of the color dopamine it with brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe of people have come out of serotonin , plants extract sucking nose , and with this thing . 
if you use a nose swallows the powder , you &apos;ll see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s in front of you are not distorted 荡然无存 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single enzyme activity of dopamine 氧化酶 change . 
dopamine matter to oral these color and oral change there must be the single dopamine 氧化酶 other chemicals . 
so , what &apos;s interesting is that the β 藤本植物 咔 there to be able to control exactly -- clapping 啉 and play color dopamine agonists 氧化酶 the potency of everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
we ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments repeatedly measure outcomes are wrong 
but if you ask Indians they would say that the plants will speak . 
what does that mean ? 
people have found 科凡 tribes in the cane is that they all die in the deep jungle found in our species , they &apos;re different . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , &quot; I want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants have to know what I say it &apos;s not . 
they said that I told you , if that circle night in the months of 17 growing plants in each one of the different languages singing to you . 
that would not let you get a Ph.D. in Harvard University , but it &apos;s far more fun than accounting spreadsheets 
now we have this question , though , some of our tragedy that compassion 离群索居 Aboriginal people to enrich their lives in the world , but as we go forward . these people on the edge of the status in history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by strong new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians , even though it &apos;s still with the Indians and the United States , Great Sioux Nation horse and carriage courtesy of the lives of people who are still in the United States . 
the threat is not race change intact donut or technological innovation , but his power line of Darwinism is barbaria . 
let &apos;s look at the Tibetan mountains , where I recently made a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal oppressed . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of the way of people &apos;s lives crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as being part of development by praise strategy 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of withstand Tibet 
this young man 班禅 皈依 喇嘛 father . 
he immediately after the invasion of Chinese people were killed . 
and the rest of his uncle displacement together into Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
there are only two years old , and he and his mother quietly put him in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister , and by the 学习班 offense behavior . 
one day she accidentally step to India and China have the fur 臂章 chairman of the country to being executed for seven years of 劳教 convicted . 
the pain of Tibet elusive redemption through the human spirit that need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve existed in the &apos; 60s , and has drained it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
entering the era of human 新石器 agricultural age revolution , we would like to these seeds poetry 萨满 Beijerinck 腊 by all the rabbi . we &apos;ve created for 社会分工 levels , and the only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to have the ability to solve the air for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a completely fully aware of the species that we have to make sure that all the race , and all these organisms to live a life of optimism 昌盛 prosperity . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern part of the 巴芬岛 at the top , and I was in some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about tells a story of his grandfather &apos;s legendary 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always Canada to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to the settlement to them . 
this man refused to move grandfather . 
his family worried that he put all of his safe , weapons , and the tools that are taken away . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the advantage of the day , thick . 
their sleds across the street in North America caribou 鹿皮 dry packet of fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside , wearing his seal leather 长裤 stool to hand , he wasn &apos;t until shit faster stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit on the edge of the blades made of and make it freezes 口水 after he becomes very robust after having &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
the skin off a pair of 挽具 dog made out of his chest again a dog sleds condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t put that in a knife shit on the ice . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
well , in many ways this is the Inuit , all the Aboriginal people in the world of the life of 顽强 becomes real . 
April 1999 area of government to Canada , than the size of Texas and California larger land 之和 returned back to the Inuit , 
I was our new home its dimensions the name of the Inuit non-Inuit Le 
this is a separate territory their resources , where all the oceans control . 
this was a very good example of a country that could do something with it , to repair the relationship between the people . 
and finally , I think for ever remote areas in the world , people are actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of our people dream of these children with our own children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a National Geographic and TV can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
DH : debate , we think , is not to convince others , but we think about the fact that we can make the world , so we could get to change the world &apos;s best at about the site of the month and a click of thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we have millions of readers magazine . 
thank you . 
the Y arcas aguera blaise of this stunning photosynth demonstration , watching this software that could change the way we use digital images from the Internet . you pick up a static image , photosynth stunning vision to create the kind of , and we can navigate . 
photosynth agueray arcas blaise demo . 
is that we see here . lots and lots and lots of bytes 千兆 gigabytes and level of our digital photographs , and they can continue to smooth full of zoom in , by the way to look at them , and they could rearrange them . 
no matter how all the data sets , images and image how big , big seadragon itself all have that kind of processing capability . 
so most of the images taken by a digital camera examples , but this is a picture , it &apos;s a different from the scan images of the Library of Congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only limit system of performance is : what factors that you &apos;re using only the screen . seadragon like 素数 is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; which is a chapter three content . 
I &apos;m going to give you prove that this is really text , images , we can do it , and you can see this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it would be a way to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
so this is a more practical , this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture , which starts did . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , readers to get better , to enjoy the reading reading the experience of joy . 
here we are doing this in a small change issues to The Guardian corner . 
we fiction advertising a high-resolution picture you see -- this is more than the average advertising normal high resolution , the picture , a lot of extra life into the content . 
if you want to see this car , and you can see here . 
you can still see the rest of the sizes , and even technology dimensions . 
in a certain way on the screen to avoid the limits of the actual use . 
we hope that this technology can reduce the cause of unnecessary window and thrown like garbage information . 
for this technology , obviously , digital maps the application of one of the applications it &apos;s obvious . 
and yet , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve created this field of our contribution . 
these were just at NASA geospatial images . 
that &apos;s overlaid processing and get on the road map of the United States . 
now , let &apos;s look at some of these , put down . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging technology : two different . 
one is seadragon , and the other lady is snavely noah graduate student at the University of Washington , the computer vision studies conducted . this research , Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Research , transcribe Rick szeliski . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see here , we can easily do multiple ways to look at pictures of images , and going to be able to do more nuanced and have at resolution browsing experience . 
but , these pictures , at the three-dimensional folding is actually a very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of tougher than this sense of space . 
because we made a major respects Posse Comitatus restrictions website , a lot of legal issues . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this by 串联 in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
DH : I &apos;ll be honest , I never thought I would end work for Microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see the original these images from a lot of different camera : from a cell phone camera into a single professional . so a lot of different objectors , all the quality of being in this environment brings together a collage . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , there &apos;s a lot of pictures visitors contains 大头 shine , etc . 
I remember here , there should be a sequence of images -- ah , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster in to reconstruct the environment . 
so the important point here ? is effectively , we can use the Internet community . we can start to get everyone to different data that everyone in the memory of the environment , collect together to build a model . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all of them . 
what this model and menacing , is the whole planet . 
and it &apos;s Stephen Lawler : tour of &quot; The Virtual Earth &apos;s long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and it becomes more valuable . 
the user , on label went will be you . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software , in the years 接合 images from around the world put together ? 
that is meaningful . this software is to explore . 
it builds up in this middle hypertext . 
this is based on the process of 接合 complete picture of content . 
the more exciting is that contains images of semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type of words , page after will contains a lot of text with this picture . 
now , suppose these images connected with you a picture of all , it would be like ? 
at that time , so these semantic information within each of links , and it &apos;s a huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you ! 
thank you very much ! 
Barry 施瓦茨 puzzled us : choices . 
and I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard that some of the things resonate with what you don &apos;t know if I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to go from a solid credo . 
what kind of creed ? 
the West is not by 笃信 industrial society , a credo . 
this credo say : what if we allow people to get the welfare , its way is to get to maximize the individual liberty . 
and the reason is free , with this stuff is beautiful , valuable , for people to essential . 
moreover , once people had freedom , our own 做主 everybody can use all the way , you don &apos;t get benefits for 做主 to others . 
the freedom to make a big enough to do is increase selective . 
the more choices of people , the more freedom , freedom , which is , to get more and more welfare state . 
I think , this idea that we , like so that when you add it into the water in a deep-seated presumption that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about a salad ingredients here . 
you see , this is what it looks like a supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one stores configuration that includes a three-dimensional stereo system -- , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , CD machine , radio , an amplifier 磁带机 . it &apos;s such a one store three-dimensional stereo system is countless more . 
using this store out of the components that you can have 3D 650万种 combination of all kinds of close acoustic system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is not a pile of choice . 
the telecommunications industry , let &apos;s switch gears . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and that , just to Maya that an Bell company . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
the phone , it &apos;s usually some bad . we &apos;re not going to die . 
一去不返 already kind of days . 
now I &apos;m almost infinite variety of mobile phone , especially -- that cartoons . 
these are the future of the mobile phone . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , nose and French forming a brownish caramel , cutting hair 布丁 torch . 
in your if you haven &apos;t seen next to the store , don &apos;t worry , and it doesn &apos;t long , you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : you have a function of not so much ? 
you think about it , answer would be ? 
the answer is no ” “ . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in some other lives more than a shopping thing for us , this effect on the explosion of choice . 
health care , already in the United States , right now -- is not a doctor , who you go to tell you how to do so in an era of . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use nail treatment 乙 , can also use the solution . 
and so forth treatments nail a solution and risk . 
and so forth treatments solutions are 乙 and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
again , the psychiatrist says nail has these effects and risk , 乙 have the negatives and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” that ? 
but my doctor , and I said , “ ” not you . 
now the prescription for pharmaceutical ad all cancers , are all of the ordinary people around you and me , if you think about it . if you said isn &apos;t it . and since we can &apos;t go straight to the counter to buy . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , we looked at their ads hope for the next morning , go back to your doctor to call the doctor , on a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our gender identity this kind of thing became a choice . it &apos;s like trying to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents down , it was invented by myself . 
so we can get back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up after you have to get to what you want to do today is one of the people who are women and men the decision . 
in terms of family in marriage , every single person in the past age is to take for granted that is almost got married , and then there &apos;s something 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what node , and it &apos;s not married later what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart magnificant students , but now I give them less than ever before assignment a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they dumb students -- than ever before , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so hardworking . 
now the reason is their brains are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself : what am I going to get married or not ? is it going to now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to the kids , and I knew business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether or not they were doing homework , I do , whether they &apos;re also in my class and take a grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can , any time of day at work in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except hotel 夫 . 
in restaurants , but it does have a place that can WiFi , but I &apos;m not going to tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I also want to use . 
then again , we work with these incredible choice , given us the freedom of choice of what we need to make decisions , again , again , again , now for an intermission , or is it going to work or chaotically . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 when the mobile phone , and in another 裤兜 blackberry pretend BlackBerry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the children in rivals for the next constantly ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
back to this email or not ? what should I shouldn &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself , you don &apos;t think the answer is that this ball for kids in the experience of the game , or is it still is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big , things are still small lifestyle choice , life is . 
we used to live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there is nothing , but not all need to choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these choices , there &apos;s two people , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , say , there &apos;s some paradox , which is , it doesn &apos;t bring us -- is a liberating , but constraints , is we numb . 
people with so many choices that was very hard to make a decision . 
let me give you just a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a peer-to-peer pension plan to invest in terms of research . 
one of my colleagues had access to record . vanguard vanguard of investment is actually a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million employees and two , 000多个 office places . 
she survey found that is , when those customers and their employees to provide the support of -- every increase the foundation of 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to choose to that it was even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow , Tomorrow &apos;s halide , of course , you would never comes tomorrow . 
don &apos;t join the plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 溜掉 symmetrical subsidies from 手边 employer . employer is very obsessed with giving them this subsidies . 
so , the results of that too many choices , possibilities is we numb . 
it makes it look like the world around us into this and this slide . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision that is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose wrong helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
and the more choices to something inexplicably to feel regret . this is one of them , is always choice , not happy with their own decisions . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
Dan . earlier today Gilbert told a enough , we see is the value of depends on the one thing that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you quit the fascinating aspect of choice , and it makes you are always the chosen for you to think 美中不足 . 
so , for example , that &apos;s not a cartoon is not New York , and if you , I &apos;ll give you a 歉 dish . 
but that &apos;s what you should think about the right thing . 
see , these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich district , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it &apos;s better than that , right ? do you think they &apos;re really bad , huh , “ “ ” ” in August , is now . 
“ neighbors Manhattan ” are not home . 
I &apos;m going to is “ park your car , and you can go back to my door ” . 
two weeks , and he was such an idea torture , every day to 念叨 lost in the good parking of opportunity . 
always “ ” opportunity cost has enabled us to make decisions that decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite remarkable . 
we have to deal with these options , the more choices to attract people , the more things which are these things at the end of the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it &apos;s also said the “ ” present , including this principle . and probably going to do step . 
but one of them a sense is , when you choose to do something , you would have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing you tend to have a lot of places , and to attract the decrease of the things that you &apos;re doing appeal to you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy them back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in the long enough to wash over time , after several times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , in the years old , and finally , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; I want to feed a jeans , this is my ” of size . 
the counter said : you want , of the comfort of sweatpants , or is it ? 
or is in front of his buttons . to pull the lockset is still sour ? 石磨 wash ? 
to kind of quickly grinds them ? 
there &apos;s mouth , until the ? he 喋喋不休 Calvary to ask . 
almost off my chin . when I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to that is only one was ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I spent a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I brought one of my place at the store 合身 pants out the door . 
I do not really wrong . those choices that I had the opportunity to do better . 
but even worse , but in your mind . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
makes me feel even worse , and the reason is because there are so many can choose , I should be in a blue jeans is just how good a rise in the right expectations . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is now a too much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best economy is at least , there &apos;s a perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really nice , but it isn &apos;t perfect . 
so I took that I &apos;ve got to go and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , apart from the right thing to improve people &apos;s expectations of how good outside doesn &apos;t offer people many benefits . 
this is just bring it to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
there &apos;s nobody to the market to understand this principle . because if they have people understand , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
this is a very similar to the fact that it &apos;s a belief : in all this stuff is really bad past everything better than now . 
when a reason why it &apos;s not good stuff , people could experience to some surprises . 
now these rich , in our civic life , the industrialized world , has for granted , for every one of the things you not only hope it &apos;s worse than you would expect . 
what you &apos;ll never be what surprises , because you and God or higher than expectations . 
what is the secret of happiness , which is you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
I don &apos;t have this thing , I tried to 凑合 . 
but can 凑合 is not necessarily a bad thing . 
now there &apos;s hundreds of blue jeans shop for you bought a pair of choice . you come back , feel not happy , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
on out there with hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t have any excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they also are very good . so disappointed to decide , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and explosive growth in clinically depressed disorder . 
and finally , the net effect is , although objectively we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
and this recognized that the choice of happiness , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . not exactly right . 
choice no better than no choice , but can &apos;t abandon picture choose more is better . 
there &apos;s a key value is , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ ’ we choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now , let &apos;s talk about a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , give us the industrialized society , is so many choices matter enormously rich . 
and there &apos;s a lot of places in the world , at least we &apos;ve heard about a few of them , where it &apos;s not too much , choice . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic modern wealthy Western society is a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive car seats to operate 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated choice to not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us harm . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not from ago . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution would make a product of all , it &apos;s not just the poor , life got better , because we got rid of that bothers us , like plague of extra choice . 
the end of the , you should look at this cartoon , a wise man standing on the positions said , &quot; Huh , this fish “ know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting that &apos;s when I read . 
but I want to feel this fish , the more clearly must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible , but you get fish break , and it &apos;s not the freedom to fish , but paralyzed , and it will be dead . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible fish to break , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you have increased was paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish -- and for this fish , maybe a little bit smaller , for us , almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic suffering , it means to fish , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects about the human genome and meaning . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective : we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to come up with some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , I think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve spent the last 20 years to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it &apos;s the world from analog in biology , computer analysis of September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life from this , or whether we can create new digital world in life ? 
this is a map of the genetic sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . for one , it &apos;s the smallest genome species can make it replicate , in the lab , we &apos;re trying to understand . and if we could find a smaller genome . 
we &apos;re able to separate out from 500组 一百组 genes that we have in front of this . 
so , we think the only way you can continue to study that was synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue questioning the basic problem . 
so we started to walk along the way that we can “ ? ” synthetic chromosomes . 
it allows us to really chemical principle that we never succeeded in making these molecules to be displayed ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in an exponential rate faster . 
the ability to write our genetic code , much slower progress , but also to increase in the situation we recently . I &apos;m going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it was for the first phase . when we did before , all of the trials conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA , in about 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , the more than that , the more the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first attempt to Phi X 174 , from the phage genome and digital information . 
we use kill bacteria is a small virus . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
the other people excited when we put phase is not live this sort of chemicals , put it into germ bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill a different 兰氏 E. coli and negative fungus . 
I recently with the oil industry , there are some of communication , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually the software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that those numbers to accurate information . 
in 1995 , when we first to this group of subjects , gene sequencing is every 10,000 basic standard for a mistake . 
again , we found that in fact , on average sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use the gene sequence , this group would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the length of the other 50 character long footage of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
we &apos;re designing one part of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we joined 水印 
consider the genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts like about 20 amino acids , every amino acids mark a character . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , verbal ideas . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign the picture . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we didn &apos;t use it to do is a poem . 
and we can use these fragments bias enzyme which cuts . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , you couldn &apos;t from 70 character length , put them together to make 24 , 1,800,000 character length , and then bring out the fragments , became the merger fragments 72 fragments , 1,800,000 long . 
at every stage , we have a lot of developing these fragments , so we can give them a sequence , because we wanted to create a very reliable process that you will see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
this is what it looks like the 对阵 篮球赛 is a graph . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep in E. coil longer in trying to do . it was in the tools of modern molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred recombinations to repair the DNA in biology , it can put together fragmented 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a microbes 球菌 called resistant to be able to withstand 三百万度 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see at the top of the images , and it everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , it &apos;s going to go back before and combinations of their original form . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes . they can totally out of water in a vacuum to survive . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a film we shot images of this molecule . these microscopic process , which is a little yeast in front of mentioned put through our way right at the design of the pieces . the yeast , automatically and aggregates . 
this is not the electron microscope pictures ; it &apos;s just a regular optics microscope . 
this is one of the molecule is so big that we can use a optics microscope to look at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open recent experiment . 
this is a far more genetic code 580000 . it &apos;s made by humans setting structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font print it out , you need to print 142页 . and those genes code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
now , obviously , with a virus , very simple process a bacterium is much more complicated . 
we deal with this really like nuclear biological and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in a cell into another , this is what you heard about cloned . 
for the bacteria , and they 连成 chromosome one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant shift the chromosome from one cell , and another cell to activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process stop there . but we &apos;re trying to take this further down the design process . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that all accepted and the second one chromosome from other species or chromosome , the third place in increased thousands and thousands of seconds , a new feature to its own . 
people were held in the process of evolution that every only going to have a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzyme , from digesting the DNA is to be . 
the chromosome out there in a cell without this enzyme , the enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it presents a out , pick out all the other chromosomes , and there is no matter , it &apos;s to digest , finally , we have a have new DNA cells . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all of the characteristics of all species hard-to-come-by disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put on the new software ” “ cells . 
all the proteins are changed , membranes and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , and in fact , it is that we will implant . 
it may sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we really get through transfer of DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we could create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
for some demand , I think the reason why we do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , become four . 
we provide the food for 65亿 , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in 捉襟见肘 did . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 of oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it program , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that we &apos;re in this material in the atmosphere of the CO2 emissions . 
we found from around the world right now , there is a database contained about 两千万组 genes , and I like to see them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now , our main limit reality from biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because these can build group that &apos;s what we call the mixing chromosomes “ fast synthetic ” approach . 
what we have the ability to make a big robots that allows us to make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start to survive the ability to choose , chemical production , or the fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the whole thing is that some of the work that we actually sit in the computer to design species actually use software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks like it . we know exactly what they &apos;re genetic code looks like . 
we focus on the “ ” 第四代 fuel . 
you saw recently into corn ethanol is going to be a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third fuel . it was sugar into higher value , for example , the fuel or different types of 丁醇 辛烷 . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide -- it &apos;s one way of doing that . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
it &apos;s being documented kind of microbes in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , methane , carbon dioxide molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to be able to collect their very convenient , and then they can be introduced into fuel , processing , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we did with the whole oil industry , with the little good . so if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there are probably ? become a major energy . 
and we are using tools made out of the same instant vaccine . 
you can all of this flu , we always have to slow down at the time and a year , the lack of money and useful vaccine . 
I think this is a vaccine that can make mixtures expected to change . 
this is the future might change the situation , accompanied by evolutionary tree , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for biology is accelerating evolution and possibly eukaryotic 
we &apos;re a farther away from improve human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure we can have a chance to live long enough to long , long time , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 speak at TED estimated in the short , Brian Cox which super Collider shares some of the news . the content , including the nest maintenance workers are now , and in the history of the landscape of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
over the last TED introduced me to speak to the LHC . 
and I said , &quot; you must go back to the machines running on to update it . 
and here it is , if you last year , the LHC is not to be in the history of the words of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
the universe , with reinventing the state of the billionth of a second per second , and it began a state of manufacturing . 
so much more ambitious . 
this is the machinery of the ground in Geneva 
we use these detectors for little photographing the Big Bang . 
this is my work on , ATLAS . the inaugural detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of the atlas portrait . 
it was the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of all the way , as we all along the LHC from the LHC plans , in part of a heat particles 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see it in September 10th of spectacle we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know is that this is still got 满堂喝彩 -- when people go to Google , you see , this is an icon front page . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of science and its impact on the same significant . 
but about a week later , we came up with some of the machine , with these 导线 导线 about -- the Golden Desert . 
more than the current conduction 导线 all 安培 when the machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers , those wires “ impossible ” too narrow . 
they can do it because they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so below minus 271摄氏度 planet in the temperature of the universe , between these 导线 situations can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 电磁铁 in 接点 九千多个 on a technology to install a mistake . 
so 导线 to rise in temperature it is a little bit more of a sudden , the current 安培 conduction by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
that was pretty shocking , because they move material weigh up to hear about a mile constructed . 
so there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
they unloaded must have done , these jobs . 
we gave them joy . it &apos;s good . 
now just waiting for them back to the ground . 
so in the back of the three refer to be the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data and continue our mission to figure out the form of the most basic units . 
now , obviously , again , so one of these accidents about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
and I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still in pursuit of facts itself projects , which is where the value of the LHC . 
thank you . 
呵护 . Elizabeth Gilbert talk for creativity and to reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life work a special events that happened , until very recently , in spite of my work , in my life , a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
now , as a result , no matter where I think , people like this . my life as a result , where no matter what I now , that people think this is my life . 
so , really , is completely , saved , play 完了 ! 
and they would be very worried “ said to me , and you don &apos;t be afraid ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of sustainable refused to take you bearing down upon ? 
your final broken dream of going to die in despair failure , full of self , and I was always get questioning , etc . 
the simplest for these questions , and the answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today , the same thing . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today , the same thing . 
in fact , in addition to these , I &apos;m afraid that many people suspect that not beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that many people think of things . 
let &apos;s say the grass , there are other things . 
but , says afraid of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? but , says afraid of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? 
this is a cerebral idea ? 
people fear destined to do their work ? it logical ? people afraid of doing their job ? and destined logical ? 
nobody says : “ meet John , chemical work ? bottlenecks ” ? 
this asked , could never happened . 
平心而论 , chemical engineers , of course , it just doesn &apos;t in the last few centuries , due to alcoholism addiction , depression and 享誉 狂躁 global didn &apos;t in the last few centuries , due to alcoholism addiction , depression and 享誉 狂躁 around the world . 
just look at the early last century , all of the great geniuses 英年早逝 area in the case of creativity just look at the early in the last century , all of the great geniuses of creativity is always the case 英年早逝 gently died of suicide . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show out of their talent , even those who have no suicide , often don &apos;t show the talent them . 
Noam 曼梅 before he died , in the last one interview I said , &quot; “ all of a book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , this is how radical statement . 
today I want to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? I &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you are not exceptions , for this ? 
you think this sentiment is not a problem ? even further away at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of a little bit further from the outside in even look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of the outside in 
this idea , and not terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this idea , and not terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want to get up to this idea that the next century , and not terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
I think that encourages us great creativity geniuses live there will be good . 
and I myself , believed that inevitably , due to put me in the dark , and I myself , believed that inevitably , due to me , especially in the dark in my career stage right now , especially in my career . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of career 
well , frankly , we were to look at the time , I would say , is a dime friends , right between the heart , potentially , that I was the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
is this idea , let people on the road wine 大清早 drank -- one of the way , is not to this idea that let people on the road 大清早 drank -- one of the way back to the wine I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to keep doing what I love writing career , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to keep doing what I love writing career , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
and after a deep thinking , in my opinion to keep writing , and I have to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create some psychological protect mechanism . 
in some way , I need to build a safe distance themselves from , and I was writing for work outcry from extreme anxious , and I was writing is extreme outcry anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because the last would go back to our problems . 
and the &#91; Ancient Rome that in Ancient Greece , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is the kind of sacred from distant and unknowable 精灵 to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable next to an artist , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks pervasive accompanied by to call this kind of creative ” 精灵 stewards for “ for it . 
and people often think Socrates have this attached to a stewards for him , from a distance that general wisdom was that people have this one -- Socrates from a distance , and gives him stewards for wisdom . 
Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius called “ 精灵 ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 ” called “ genius 
this wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ is a particularly intelligent ” genius of individuals . 
this is amazing , and this is what I was looking at this safe distance from work is to get people to protect the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , isn &apos;t it ? 
and by this ancient artists get protection , averted excessive narcissistic ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ ” genius of the project . 
if you work very bad at it , and also , not all you &apos;re wrong . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad “ ” genius 
now , Westerners in the past , this is a very long time , the way to look at creativity 
and I &apos;m saying is that , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , which was fragile one-nth of responsibility , it &apos;s too big . 
this was completely straight up twisted , one of the self and for people expect that the expansion of the great achievement , completely straight up twisted , one of the self and for people expect achievement , too . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years , I think many artists to get this pressure , is in the last 500 years stifle countless artist . 
if that is true , at least , so I think this is the question is : what we do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : we do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to more ancient past , to reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to more ancient past , to reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not work . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking in the developed 500多年 rational human mind , we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking in the developed 500多年 rationality . 
well , maybe I could convince you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any of you who &apos;ve tried to make sure you all sitting there going through this creative process , doesn &apos;t always know rational . 
and in fact , the creative process , the common , sometimes it &apos;s just beyond 
it &apos;s like the Mall , on a emptying down at her . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with the only thing she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
in some other time , this is the most called me memorable : in other parts of the time , this is the most amazing part : they called me and she said , sometimes she are almost 错过 poem . 
and then she &apos;ll extend your other hand , grab that poem tail , you get it back on the other hand , poetry 誊写 to put it on paper , get back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , poems will intact , which is in reverse order , except that piece of paper , from the beginning , by the word , to go after the first words . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s unbelievable , the creative process , and I , of course , it &apos;s not me ! -- all of the creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my work , so much more like the way . 
but even 古板 , sometimes I get incredible inspired by accident , but even 古板 , sometimes I get incredible inspired by accident . 
in a lot of people may also have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , and I have met don &apos;t know where inspiration , even if you want 墨守成规 people like me , and I have met don &apos;t know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on here ? 
in how we &apos;re going to look at it , not rational ? we have lost in how to look at it , don &apos;t have lost rational ? 
he hasten to want to capture it , but there is no way , he didn &apos;t piece of paper and pen , it doesn &apos;t have a tape recorder he hasten to want to capture it , but there is no way , he &apos;s not a tape recorder , and there &apos;s no pen and paper .

the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer and the professional performing a wonderful , because they &apos;re great professional dancer . 
occasionally , although rarely see , but actually going to happen to be a dancer something beyond the transcendent 出世 . 
you should know what I say this is because you &apos;ve all seen at some point the performance . 
that seems to be stopped in time , the dancers through time , it seems to be stopped , across the dancer like and what he did not perform 1000场 before , but all of these different amazingly , it together . 
he impressed is not a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , from the bottom glow .

everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
in Spain , when one performer done some amazing people , for the magic of all are cheering you on your way : would you “ 嘞 Alabama 嘞 , Alabama , you know , really , that &apos;s great , great . that &apos;s incredible miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , of the most intractable is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 artists around to wake up , of the most intractable is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn wake up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning that &apos;s already , and he was no longer miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old , and he might mortals couldn &apos;t get the height of the last night . 
maybe he &apos;ll never somebody dance in the realm of all are cheering you on your way miracles , since he was going to do ?

but maybe without so painful , we thought , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
if we think this problem , everything changed .

and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you know , 嘞 ! 
from here at TED , and Al Gore has shown on the new situation , global climate trend to think more than scientists predictions about , and that &apos;s worth “ clean coal ” for him . 
Al Gore climate trends warning about recently . 
last year , I &apos;m going to show you two demos the polar ice cap about in the last 三百万年 equivalent to the size of South America by the 48 state reducing 40 percent . 
but that doesn &apos;t exactly this question of , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like a global climate system beating heart 
the heart actually hyperextending . summer in winter . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years may very well . 
red is a permanent was freezing ice 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue , and this is a form of the Year every winter permanent was freezing ice in summer , ice . 
the so-called ” “ permanent was freezing , I &apos;m talking about five or more time to form of ice you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and by was freezing 干冰 microbes -- clean defrost , methane , carbon . 
if you break the top , it &apos;s going to greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in Lake already you can see a went out of the water . 
at the last winter , professor of Mayors walter alaska 结队 katey lightly to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the heat of heat sink Greenland . 
this is one of the Chambal melting every year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq Greenland 
if you want to understand how the ice is on the land of sea level rise to the mouth of the Nung here is it . 
there are dramatic rise of the traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report to reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
so that &apos;s equivalent to the sea 20 feet , and Greenland . 
the third largest ice in himalayas at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
the water from the 40 percent of the world for being half of the water . 
in the Andes , it is the city of ice , drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
Sierra of snow in California , 40 percent reduction per year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to fire and dry dramatically increase the numbers . 
and the number of the world in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
disaster in the last 30 years , in relation to the sums up four 七十五年 earlier . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
and if you look at the next history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the past five years we added CO2 两千五百万吨 七千万吨 CO2 emissions from the ocean . 
watch the Americas east to the west , from the Pacific region in India on the continent time dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
the reason why the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
coal oil is the most urgent is really important . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
build a solution was to use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see a sea change . 
this is what has and some new some of the green alternative . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
carbon and oil and coal industries 两千五百万美元 spent in the last year to promote clean coal , &quot; That &apos;s a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what reminded me of a picture . 
before Christmas , Tennessee in my hometown of billions of digging muck up the coal . 
you probably saw on the news 
the second largest here , is to put up with some wastewater . 
in Christmas before this happen . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal carbon industry ad . 
and the coal cool is happy and happiness . 
you can see him in the United States , more productive , and he also help us about the economic development . 
and the coal cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s the west , many of the original virginia our coal . 
that &apos;s the largest Mayors , the head of the coal mining massey 
and so , climate protection is allies , and Al Gore president now one of the people who work on two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change threat . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of coal mining and define what the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean the smell of good . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s go to look like the art of clean coal factory . 
some 喧哗 machine spectacular ! 
but this is the sound of clean coal technology . 
although burn coal with global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here a clean coal fascinated exciting technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now a clean coal technology . 
this is a final solution that can handle the economic challenge and national security challenges . 
the economic crisis is in the United States , national security , climate crisis 
all these crisis strings together is based on carbon oil , for instance , the dirty production is dependent on foreign oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve these problems . 
clean america repower with 100 percent of the last 10 years of electricity . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and let the Earth isn &apos;t in global warming . 
eventually , a large enough solution to solve our problems . 
to understand more america repower . 
the final 
this is about america repower . 
in the old oil and dirty murder of our planet , and it &apos;s dependent on it for us to reduce the fastest way . 
here in the future . wind , solar , a new network of energy . 
investment to create a new kind of work . 
has america repower . this is the time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about when you &apos;re being played kit . 
when you design , and how to build with Legos to hands-on , it &apos;s actually when you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . this is the object 空间结构 to understand and perception . 
空间结构 understanding of objects around us very helps us to learn a lot of things . 
some of the questions that are sitting in my mind , so we decided to find answers , so to have this siftables . 
simply said , &quot; which is a siftable interacting with computers , it &apos;s like the crackers size . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable can move each other , the perception siftable 每块 each other , and the monitor and radio device . 
and most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
this tool , more independent , more sensitive to each other , perceiving any subtle sense of mobile , so we can use this kind of interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
this siftable configuration that reflection is , if I put it to the side of that , so it can lean towards the image that here also , if I put it in the opposite direction , then images and lean towards the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if you give them a 挨 a resounding OK , interesting phenomenon that &apos;s going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , and they would also be aware of , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other &apos;s perception and tilted . 
we found an interesting interaction through some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables upside down , like a liquid that you pour it from a color to another siftable siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there are three sets of siftables into paint barrels model , we can put these bucket pour the color in the middle of blurred together , put colors . 
if it , it can go back . 
and the function of siftables machine learning , and we can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions , on-the-spot to learn to become more quickly see the results . 
this is my show siftables here -- and the reason is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
it can play together siftables games -- a word and boggle scrabble remix of games . 
this game spell a word , you just take a piece of a letter siftable with dollars , and when you put together siftables letters of the words , it would be in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of words , right , you can also trying to build new in other words , the letters . 
thank you Thank you . 
now , so it &apos;s screen in the Media Lab some children are involved in the test siftables experience , I &apos;m going to experience of children , we took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , which is a game ” “ together words , they know how to do . 
now on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
and this is the right-hand corner the youngest of ages . 
he just wanted to siftables stack together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now on the screen to an animation function of interaction . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is that the child is called Felix . 
he could use some new graphics to add elements , what he did was put on the table , toward the siftables pick up some graphics , you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he put add up to the Sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now he put tractors add up . 
in orange . 
do good ! 
to put siftables graphics can bring forth a new element in his picture to add up to a new element 吠 -- dogs . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open-ended in the end of the story of how a plan , his story . 
sitting in a cat off . 
and I &apos;m going to show you one last show this to be function , playing music is even recently we &apos;ve developed , siftables in this capability of the sound domain , can make a sound like 超载 and Bess and note the sound of a drum . 
every tiles modulation , that &apos;s 任君 四档 choice . 
you can take the sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable tiles siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles tiles . 
there is something like a mixed 响器 of sound filter , siftable module . 
to put this kind of tiles that you can adjust sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control the overall rhythm and volume of tiles tiles siftable siftable editing close to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
started to get into two editors 超载 note , and then add some 超载 tiles . 
now to join 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter modules , Drums tiles that can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to just accelerated pace a little bit closer to edit rhythm tiles module . 
now , and the filter sound filter tiles near Bessel tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can do . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance playing , but in all editing , but long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles , with tiles on the left to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium for computer-human interaction with the human brain better . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you that we communicate on the idea was to develop a new generation of combining cutting-edge technology -- and I can digital media 接轨 technology to bring to the world , it &apos;s going to change this revolution in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect common explore with you .
