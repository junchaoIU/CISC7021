and through pictures rapture , for National Geographic by Wade Davis explorers of the world to celebrate culture as the Native Americans , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate of the Earth . 
talk by Wade Davis endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same kind of a flexible rule . 
we are all born 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to of the week . 
we have a 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 苦楚 of life that we create art . 
but you can see that each rhythm and pace , the music , dance has unique . 
all these different groups of the show us how to survive and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think about what you would be a different way of thinking that you see the future . 
the culture of the world by 五彩缤纷 犹如 a spiritual life and culture of the Internet to cover the whole of the Earth , it &apos;s a very important 芸芸众生 , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the Internet . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , and it &apos;s a very strong , as we look at the species . 
and like all of the biosphere as a species , the same as the end of the world , and it faster . 
this is one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet have 6 : 00 a native language . 
and language is not just sounds grammatical rule . 
the human spirit , a flash of light . 
it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the spirit of the world in the dictionary 承 . 
each one is a language that an ecosystem with a long time and precipitation . 
we know , 6 : 00 on a planet with language that we &apos;re all in the same amount of language , there is no longer have to teach kids . 
that &apos;s not the language of 传人 act , unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be a 本族语 and say , there was no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of how this would be lonely and scary . 
and in fact , one of the Earth is about every two weeks , you have to be a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race to the race to you in a circle , and you come in to lose civilization . 
there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I told you a different way of living ” “ in front of it , and I said ” “ different ways . 
the children , for example , in the Northwest 亚玛逊 in Arabic is that they &apos;re called 蚺 because they believe in a race of the time they 米尔克 coming from the of the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t tell the difference between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 and so in their and no difference in the forest canopy 
they said , the language of a strange and follow some rules 通婚 异族 通婚 called this went to the people with a different kind of language , married people . 
this is based on the history of mythology and you can see through the phenomenon of one of the wedding 异族 of language , there &apos;s a very often 六七种 you never see 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast 华拉尼 in Ecuador , is the most amazing people , one of the genocide in 1958 , and I &apos;m used to that they had to peace . 
five years , the missionaries 1957 to them , but these people are trying to make a mistake . 
they dropped from the air , they 十张 eight to myself , in this picture that we are , but they didn &apos;t think that these people who live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest , and then get over these pictures are trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil . and they use it with the missionaries 戮 five died . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 external 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
we found only to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 两例 刨根问底 natural death , and they said , the truth , and being able to do the same old wooden , they &apos;re going to die , and he &apos;s 戮 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have the 惊诧 revealed . 
they can be a predator 开外 to smell urine of animals , and they know what it is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand the way I have to figure out what this mysterious voodoo teach religion is going to teach a voodoo magic is the dark . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the world is going to give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
in living soul . 
the rhythm can tap dances 大水 to just replace the soul of the soul of the living in a flash of light that moment for 侍僧成 . 
so , voodoo who say you like to call to go to church worship of God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
in all of those groups I live in the north of Columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 mountains of the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny in ancient civilization ; they at Columbia and in the area of the little plain . they go back to the isolated in one of the plain . 
in this bloody ethnic across the globe that have never been to the people . 
and they were going to be the monks 续 of 训诫 monk , but they &apos;re very different . 
they like to go back to the 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain these values , and the universe is the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it . 
they call myself for lies over , we say we are in the world . 
the ability to create this intuition , very important . 
it &apos;s not going to indigenous 多愁善感 思乡 would not suffer the pain of . 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is the mountain . this is a bunch of 矿石 or . 
this is a symbol of the meaning of the relationship with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , by the local people in the mind , I think is going to be cut down . 
if you look at it this way that you will find a different way of life , and you &apos;ll understand very different way of life . 
this is a picture of me last year in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it , it &apos;s a very strong component of the spirit of the plant it 萨满教 徒 often die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent dopamine in the color of the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 from the people in the serotonin , plants extract nose and continuing with this thing . 
if you take a nose , you can see the powder in these hallucinations , these wacky , in a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s in front of you are not 荡然无存 distorted 
but that doesn &apos;t matter oral dopamine color , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
these oral substance to color dopamine , and there &apos;s going to change the dopamine oral 氧化酶 chemicals in the other . 
what &apos;s interesting is that the 藤本植物 β 咔 啉 -- there was going to be able to suppress the dopamine agonists 氧化酶 to work with the color , so that everyone must ask yourself , you . 
we &apos;re going to do all kinds of experiments that ordinary people to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask people , is to say that they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people die in the cane is all in the deep jungle , and we found them in a different species . 
if you ask them to the hierarchy is how the plants and they said , &quot; I want you to have some plants . 
you know , there &apos;s some plants , and I said , is not . 
I tell you that if they said this in a month to circle around each one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. from Harvard , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem that some of us , with indigenous people think that compassion 离群索居 enrich their lives , but over the world , we &apos;re moving forward to these people in the history of the back . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
even though is called the Sioux with , and it &apos;s the interest and is going to sit still and the people in the United States . 
the threat of race or intact technological innovation is not change , but he &apos;s the power of . 
now , let &apos;s see mountains in Tibet , I do a lot of the research , where you can see some of the authoritarian political . 
and the genocide , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of the way of life , but not denounce crimes are in a lot of it as being part of the credit . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with that . 
and this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
he immediately after the Chinese people were killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together into Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
there &apos;s only two years old , and he and his mother and quietly in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because of his behavior , and my sister was just the 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of being 臂章 and in the country for seven years of 劳教 . 
the pain of Tibet for the elusive redemption we need to get to see . 
and we &apos;ll have a choice is that we want to live in a single one of the world still need to 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve 60 drained . it &apos;s going to feel guilty . 
human time 新石器 into an agricultural revolution , we would like to seed 腊 萨满 &apos;s poetry is the rabbi . and we created a level of all of this : 00 社会分工 10 years ago . 
modern industrial society 三百年 only in history . 
in my view of history , that &apos;s enough to have the capacity for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in the song , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully conscious of the species that we have to make sure that all those 昌盛 race , and all of life . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern part of the 巴芬岛 at the top and some of the Inuit , to catch the 奥拉雅 narwhals , who told me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government doesn &apos;t do the Inuit , to build our national sovereignty away , and we &apos;re going to -- to them . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
he worried about his family , safe , weapons , and he took all the tools . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is one of the thick . 
they sleds across the street in North America for the first 鹿皮 caribou package of the fish was freezing . 
this man , don &apos;t fear the grandfather of the night and 凛冽 . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside in his skin 长裤 shit . he wasn &apos;t until shit faster to fingers stiffen , he put it into the blades . 
and in this shit , on the edge of a 口水 blades , and make it becomes very frozen solid , and then he put &apos;ve dealt with this having a dog . 
the skin of a dog made out of the 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds set out to the other was a dog . don &apos;t have that are made of manure on the knife . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
well , in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of the life of indigenous 顽强 becomes real . 
April 1999 to Canada , more than one area the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land are Inuit people . 
and it &apos;s our new home , the name of the dimensions , New Le 
and this is one of their independence , where all the oceans control . 
this is a very good example of a country can do something with it , to repair the relationship between the people . 
and finally , I &apos;ve been to think that the world of some remote places , it wasn &apos;t there . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids to the world , is part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through a National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people think about it , but we can change the world , so we can get in the world of the fact that we talk about a month click on the website of the amount of three to five million 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we have millions of the audience . 
thank you . 
the Y blaise aguera arcas demos this stunning photosynth of this software , we can change the way to use digital images from the static , pick out the photosynth stunning , and we can dream of . 
blaise arcas photosynth agueray . 
we see there are lots and lots and lots of bytes 千兆 gigabytes . and in our digital photographs , and they can continue to the full , by the way you can look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
no matter how many of all the data sets , images , and the size of the images , all of this seadragon processing capability . 
so most of the images taken by a digital camera , but this is a picture of it , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress , like 3亿个 scan the picture . 
and yet , it &apos;s not different , because the only things with our system , you know , just like a screen seadragon 素数 . and it &apos;s a very , very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , that &apos;s a chapter three . 
I &apos;m going to give you a text that it &apos;s not like this , we can do , and you can see that this is really , it &apos;s not a text , images . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
now , that &apos;s a more , and this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture , which starts did . 
the newspaper or a magazine , and it involves making multiple versions of scale , in reading , people will get better , reading to enjoy the experience of joy . 
here we are doing this in a small change issues in The Guardian on it . 
we had a figment of high-resolution picture you see this -- this is the normal high resolution advertising , to a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see the car , you can see here . 
you can see , even version of the other dimensions technology . 
in this way , to actually avoid the use of the screen . 
we want it to be able to cut out the window and play . 
and of course , this map , number one of the applications , and it &apos;s obvious . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and we get to the top of the road map . 
now , let &apos;s look at some of these , put it down . 
in fact , this online , and you can go and experience . 
this is called the photosynth , it actually two different kinds of technology . 
one is , and the other , seadragon from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely that the computer vision . I get the University of Washington , Steve seitz . 
and Rick szeliski Microsoft Research . this is the help of a very nice . 
this is on the Internet , it &apos;s based on a building seadragon technology . 
and you can see , we have a way to look at the image of the picture , and they would do very much at the resolution and have to experience . 
but these images in the space , which is actually a very significant . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have more time to mapping the environment . 
this is a lot of sense of the space of it . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 in space . 
and so , we can easily go to . 
and in fact , I never thought I would come and work for Microsoft . 
so , it was really exhilarating . 
I think you can see from these images , a lot of the camera , from a single cell phone to get the quality of different . so , in this environment , were all together . 
I &apos;m going to get some pictures of a weird . 
see , a lot of the picture of a tourist 大头 and so on . 
I remember here -- should have a sequence of images , here . 
this is the Notre Dame poster in Paris . 
we can get to see the poster of the environment . 
the point here is that ? well , we can use the Internet community . we can start to get everybody &apos;s data to collect different memory in the environment , and build a model . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , a much more than just going to take all of them . 
this is a model , is the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like , &quot; The Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , the market . 
this kind of model , and people are using the complexity , it becomes more valuable . 
pictures of the , you will be in . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right now , you &apos;ll be able to put in the years of 接合 images from around the world ? 
the software . this is actually is to explore . 
it builds up in this links between . 
this is the process of 接合 based on the content of the picture completely . 
the more exciting , is a picture of text semantic contains information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type of words , that &apos;s going to be a lot of text with this picture . 
now , all of these pictures and images , are you ? 
at that time , so the semantic information in the next to each other , and it &apos;s a huge volumes . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise congratulate , just incredible . you . 
thank you very much . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
and I think I &apos;m here to talk about this book , and I hope it &apos;s part of what you &apos;ve already heard with some of the things that if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
and I think of a credo . 
the tenets of what ? 
the whole industry is Western society of not 笃信 by a credo . 
this is the principles that , if we want to get people to make the benefits of the way , is to make it to the best personal freedoms . 
and the reason is free , and that is , people have , need to value . 
and once you have the freedom , we can use to 做主 all the benefits , don &apos;t have to get people 做主 for . 
the freedom to do a lot to do is increase the selection . 
the more people , and the more freedom , freedom , the more and more of it . 
I think , like the idea , so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in order to people didn &apos;t want to ask questions about it . 
and the same deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
and I &apos;m going to show you some examples . look at the progress of modern society , we become possible to do things . 
this is my local supermarket . one , but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the ingredients salad . 
you see , that &apos;s what it looks like a supermarket . 
and one of you turn it into a pop-up stores a stereo system -- and CDs , a speaker , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a three-dimensional stereo system in the one that &apos;s a lot more . 
with components of this store , and you can have a combination of all the three-dimensional 650万种 sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
let &apos;s talk about , a communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and Maya , you have to go , a company that . 
you don &apos;t have to buy , just to go back to rent a 电话机 . 
and the phone , and that &apos;s not going to die . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now we have almost infinite variety of a mobile phone , and that . exactly . 
these are the cell phone . 
and I love most in the middle -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play a cut hair , and the French 布丁 forming a brownish caramel torch . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store , you don &apos;t worry about , how long it . you &apos;ll see . 
this is the outcome , people went to the store and said , you don &apos;t have a function of with this much ? 
you want to say that ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t do not buy a cell phone , so many things . 
again , in the lives of more than any other shopping thing for us , and the effect of the Big Bang . 
the health care in the United States , right now -- is not a doctor , you go to your doctor , so how do you do to tell the time . 
instead , you get to the doctor , would you say , we can use nail treatment 乙 , you can use it . 
and so forth . and there &apos;s a very nail . 
and so forth , and I have a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
they say it and nail these effects , there &apos;s a very 乙 risk , and the risks . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” ? 
they said , but I don &apos;t you “ ” is . 
now , the drugs , all of the recipe for all of the ordinary people around you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s just say , we can &apos;t buy directly to the counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , we looked at their ads , to the next morning , go to the doctor to call your doctor prescribed , put them in the drug . 
now , like the gender of the identity of this , we have a choice . just like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but things by themselves . 
so we could get back to the gender of the shape itself . 
this is every morning you woke up to you today , you have to get to the people who want to be a kind of men and women -- the decision . 
in terms of family in the last marriage , everybody &apos;s got married . this is the age of things , and then there &apos;s 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , when I got married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can be used to take the 挑拣 拣 . 
I was the best students a bunch of smart , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , the fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they were dumb , and the students -- and it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t worked so . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , and I ask myself , what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and then I &apos;ll come back to the first is , I knew it work ? 
this is the problem of 脑筋 . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether or not they do I do , whether they work in my class , what do we take . 
they want to go to the problem , because it &apos;s important question . 
now , who &apos;d like to say , we really is a blessing , we can make progress in one day , any time in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but in this restaurant , there &apos;s a place of wireless , but I can go online , where they &apos;re not going to tell you . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
we say , the incredible work that we have the freedom of choice is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about it . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 on the phone , and the other 裤兜 blackberry BlackBerry , and it goes on the laptop . 
even if they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the rivals for children and ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick up the phone ? 
or you don &apos;t go back to the email ? should I wrote this 信稿 ? 
even if you don &apos;t like to their kids , you know , is that this is the experience of the game is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big stuff , and in the way , that &apos;s life . 
the world we live in the past . 
that means , choice is still there , but not to have nothing to do . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all of these people have two choices , and it &apos;s negative impact on the two . 
one , to do it , paradoxically , it is . it &apos;s not that we have , inside , it is we numb . 
so a lot of people in the face of that is very , very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , and this is a plan to invest in terms of his retirement income . 
a colleague of mine came in contact with the vanguard vanguard . in a big company , with a foundation of about two million people , and they 000多个 place . 
and she found was that when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 people than you down for five , 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to come to that . it &apos;s not even more difficult and so on , you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
a major tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
this is not to plan for a year , they make up from an employer 5千元 溜掉 . symmetrical 手边 employer is going to provide are obsessed with this . 
so , it &apos;s too much choice is numb . 
and it allows us to the world look like this and this slide . 
and when you go into the 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
there , you don &apos;t want to be wrong , which helps fund or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , and that was a strange regret . this is one of them , is always choice , not happy with ourselves . 
and second , is what economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today about Dan Gilbert . one is enough , we see a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of options , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the side of the people , and that makes you like to think that you see the 美中不足 . 
let me give you an example . so , that if you didn &apos;t have the New York , I have a 歉 . 
but this is what you want to be right now . 
look at these two 口子 the Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it &apos;s better than that , right ? it was really bad , huh , “ ” “ ” in August , is now . 
so the “ neighbors ” at all . 
I &apos;m going to “ is to stop that can go back to my door ” . 
two weeks , and it turns out that he was suffering from an idea , 念叨 lost in every day , that &apos;s the best chance . 
” “ opportunity cost , we always have enough to make decisions and in fact , even with a remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things , which is the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
and this cartoon for that problem . 
it &apos;s also said the present “ ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but it is , one of them , when you choose to do something that , you have chosen not to do other things . 
these are the things that you would have drawn down , and you &apos;re going to do . 
and third , through expectations . 
and I have to buy it in a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
that &apos;s the last , jeans , you buy a car , no pants , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to do that , that has happened to be 凑合 pants . 
so , in many , many years old , and finally , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want to have a jeans , this is the size of the ” me . 
and , you have to say , the comfort of the type of sweatpants , or is it ? 
and to the front of his buttons . the lockset is 石磨 , or is it ? do that ? 
the grind to that fast ? 
and it &apos;s the back of his mouth ? 喋喋不休 to ask . 
it was my chin . when I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to be the only thing that was a ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , I took a look , I had never 合身 out the door of the store . 
I don &apos;t do it . I had the opportunity to do better . 
but it worse in your mind . 
why ? it &apos;s that I wrote a book for me to make excuses . 
I felt worse , and the reason is because there &apos;s so much , I can choose a jeans , what about what is a really good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . and that &apos;s a jeans , so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really nice , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I had to me , and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expect that , I get really down . 
in the lives of people together , except for the choice to raise what people are good things to the outside it didn &apos;t expect that . how many people . 
that &apos;s not what makes people happy with that , even though it &apos;s good . 
the market , not to understand this , because if they are . you know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what it is . I mean , I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all the bad things are better than now . 
and the reason is not a good thing , there are some amazing experience . 
now , in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the only thing that you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
you don &apos;t know what , what would be because of the day I than you would expect . 
what is the secret of happiness , which is here today to you want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s talk about today , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
I don &apos;t have the 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of on the jeans for you , you buy a choice , it doesn &apos;t come back , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously , the answer to that question is : you . 
you can do better . 
and there on the jeans , hundreds of these , you don &apos;t have gotten excuses . 
and it turns out , when they decided to do that , even though it &apos;s good for them to be disappointed . so , to blame myself . 
in the generation of us , in the developed countries -- industrialized world and explosive growth is clinically depressed . 
and the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel in . 
I remind you . 
and this is the choice , happiness , of principles , and we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s completely wrong . that &apos;s not right . 
and there &apos;s no choice but to choose not to have this picture , the more choices . 
here &apos;s the key is , I don &apos;t know how many . 
but I &apos;m sure we ‘ far beyond what we choose the richest and the key to ’ value . 
I said . here is a policy question , we have a policy question is , of our industrial society to so many choices , it &apos;s a lot of stuff . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world , we &apos;ve heard about a few of at least in there , it &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about the topic of modern Western societies are of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seat 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated , it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually hurt us . 
they don &apos;t actually makes us in . 
this is what economists call 帕累 and improve the way . 
redistribution products to all , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us out of a pandemic . 
before the end of it , you look at this cartoon , and in a position of “ guy , huh , this fish , know what ? 
to tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no , I first saw it -- have a picture of what it is . 
but the more , I want to be clear that it was a fish . 
because if you want to let me get there , and you get to the fish , it &apos;s not the freedom to fish , but I was going to die . 
if you want to get to a fish , and you break down the happiness . 
you are , the less is paralyzed . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and in this fish -- for this fish , maybe a little bit , is almost certainly for us is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish , and that means that , maybe it &apos;s going to be suffering , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before I talk about this project is part of the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new way to look at biology , we &apos;re doing the work of digital . and now we &apos;re trying to go to the digital code in biology , a new design and synthetic life . 
we often trying to come up with some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists to try to understand that in a different level . 
we had to do a lot of it that way , the components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years , when we go to sequence human genomes in the world from analog in biology , computer analysis of September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can , or whether we went from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome , it can replicate in the lab , we &apos;re trying to understand . and if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from the 500组 一百组 is that we make these . 
so , the only thing that we think this is the synthetic chromosomes , so we can continue to change its part of the basic questions . 
so we started to walk along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
it allows us to chemical principle that we never succeeded in making these molecules displayed ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosomes , and by the way , is just some of the chemicals that lived there . 
we are the digital life in an exponential rate faster . 
we have the ability of the genetic code , and very slow progress , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work , 15 years ago . 
in fact , it for the first stage . we do in the first time , the biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , that &apos;s very hard to synthesize DNA . 
in the world &apos;s 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 , and this is a character that will make the back of the process , a long time , the more it wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments in and out of it all together . 
this is the first time , we tried to the X 174 from Phi phage genome and to the digital information . 
is a small kill bacteria . 
we designed it through the genes , it &apos;s wrong with , say , a symbol of DNA . 
and the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live in the chemicals that bacteria , and started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells out and back to the virus particles that killed 兰氏 E. coli and negative fungus is different . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , and I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually a software to build in biological systems in the hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer . that &apos;s starting to use these numbers to accurate information . 
when we &apos;re the first time in gene sequencing to this group of subjects , is a fundamental mistake about 10,000 . 
in fact , we found , in order to 30 , on average , it &apos;s wrong . and if we use the genetic sequence , this would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the rest of the character of pieces of the time to build smaller . we need to design , they can come together . 
one of the design of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about the genetic code . there are four : a , C , G and T . 
so far 三联 -- and the way that we can ask about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a map . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
first , what we do is working with it . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we don &apos;t use it for a poem . 
and that we can use the enzyme which cuts bias . some are enzymes to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time to time getting out , and at a time . 
each of us on the stage , so that we can sequence , because we wanted to give them a process of creating a credible , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve the level of the automate . 
it &apos;s like a 篮球赛 对阵 here . 
when these very fundamental piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , it &apos;s hard to keep them in the long coil . and try to do in the modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a way to reprogram biology called kindred , to repair the DNA , put it into a piece . 
here &apos;s an example of microbes there called resistant to be able to withstand 球菌 三百万度 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see on the top , it &apos;s used in all of the chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , and put it back to the combination of before . 
we can do that , there are thousands of microbes . 
it can get out of water . they can , in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that life in outer space , and there , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule . these microscopic through the process , which is what the yeast , and the way we design and put it into the yeast . they are going to talk , automatically . 
it &apos;s not just the electron microscope picture ; it is the normal optics microscope . 
this is one of the molecule is so big that we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
it &apos;s about these 六秒 image . 
this is what we came up with the recent experiment . 
this is a far more than the genetic code 580000 . this is a set of human and make the structure of molecules . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t 10-point font , depending on it . and you need to print out the genetic code to print 142页 
so how do we get to a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously a very simple , with a virus that bacteria do much more complicated . 
we deal with this kind of like that and relatively simple one , and then you can take the cells into another , this is what you find out about it . 
and they &apos;re for the whole cells with one last 连成 , but we also know that we can do a whole the chromosome from transplanting cells to another one of the cell and activate it . 
and the new into cells . 
in fact , we thought that this process , but we &apos;re trying to go to the more the design process . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that all the species . the second and third , from the rest of the chromosomes , within seconds in the thousands and thousands of new features to its own . 
people who were all the time in the process of evolution that &apos;s the idea of a genetic change a lot of ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called enzyme , from digesting the DNA is to be limited . 
the chromosome out of the cell , no , no and enzymes , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
and that &apos;s it out , pick out all the other , it &apos;s the matter to them , and we have to have a new DNA . 
we put it into a gene causing the blue . 
in a very short period of time , out of the characteristics of all species , and completely gone into a new species , we put the cells on “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is the fact that we will implant . 
this may seem like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move , through DNA to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not -- this is the creation , with 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
I think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we &apos;re going to the people in the next 40 years from a 65亿 nine billion . 
in my own , and I was born in 1946 . 
now in the world would be the three people in every single one of us from 1946 , there in the next 40 years , in four . 
we 65亿 of people in the water , clean , all the fuel , very difficult . 
that &apos;s which 捉襟见肘 nine billion people . 
we use 50亿顿 300多亿桶 over oil , coal . that &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace , or any of the program , it &apos;s a big challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material out of the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world , there &apos;s a database of 两千万组 about genes , and I like to see them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have the technology , because we can make a group called the ” “ the synthesis of the way . 
what we have the ability to make a robot that we can make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard . we can choose to live , the ability to produce or chemical production , the fuel . 
this is a screenshot . some of the thing is , we sat down in the computer to actually design the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on the ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see corn ethanol . it &apos;s just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . it &apos;s a high value , for example , the more fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
and one of the carbon dioxide -- is . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the source of energy . 
if we can look at the two things , to get their , they can be very convenient , to try to drive into the fuel . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can increase the life for ? &quot; &quot; what is the understanding of basic questions . 
we did with the whole oil industry a little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where they could be a major ? . 
and we are using tools made out of the time . 
you can all of this flu , we &apos;re always going on in a year , and the lack of money , when the vaccine . 
and I think this can be a vaccine was to make change . 
this is the future might change the situation , with evolutionary tree , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last , and that is accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re getting a better life away from the human . and our goal is to make sure that we have the opportunity to live long enough , maybe it can do that . thank you very much . 
in this short on 09年 estimated at TED , Brian Cox Collider shares some of which are the news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : what the LHC out ? 
in the last year at TED , I speak at the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to talk about it in a row of machine . 
and here it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
the universe to reinvent the billionth of a second per second , and began to make a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the ground in Geneva . 
and we use these little changes to the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the atlas of building magnificent scale , you can see that big . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first of all the way these small along , as we all around the LHC from the LHC plans , in a part of the particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September , we know that it would do it . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know , this is a 满堂喝彩 -- is that when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of research on this as it were . 
but about a week later , we came up with a machine that does to the main 导线 导线 -- the gold . 
these 导线 transmission , and they all 安培 current . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say , these wires “ can &apos;t read ” too . 
they can do that , because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so below minus 271摄氏度 planet in the middle of the universe is so strong that can 导线 transmission of electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 of a technology for 接点 there is a mistake . 
and so 导线 temperature rises a little bit more to it , and then the transmission is electrical resistance 安培 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the material you hear about a mile and a ruler . 
there &apos;s about 50 of those magnets . 
they unloaded , put down to the work done . 
we gave them joy . it &apos;s good . 
now , back to them . 
in about three to refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it in June and July data , and then we have to figure out the mission of the most basic units . 
now , obviously , again , one of the accident , so the frontier of science and engineering , but it &apos;s very easy to . &quot; 
and I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but the fact that we are the projects , which is the value of the LHC . 
thank you . 
Elizabeth Gilbert 呵护 . about creativity and make them . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
and I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , but nonetheless , a specific event recently in my life &apos;s work , I had to make a specific event , and I think again about the relationship between my work . 
now , it turns out to people , and I think this is my life , and the result is whether people , and I think this is my life . 
so , really , really , to play , 完了 saved . 
they would come up with a very quickly , and I said , “ ? no . you not afraid to go beyond that you don &apos;t have that book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I have the question is , of people saying , you may not work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of going to continue to collapse on you ? 
broken , and you will die dream of despair , in the center of the things I was always get question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all these people are afraid to let it today . 
yes , all these people are afraid to let it today . 
and this was a lot of other people , I don &apos;t think that this was a lot of other people , I don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , and there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I was wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I was wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people are afraid of doing the work of their own destiny ? this logic ? people in the fall of their logic ? it work ? 
no one said , &quot; John , chemical “ work ? I met a bottleneck ” ? 
it could never ask . 
and of course , this chemical 平心而论 engineers , not just in the last few centuries of addiction , depression , alcoholism 享誉 狂躁 around the world , and not in the last few centuries of addiction , depression , alcoholism 享誉 狂躁 and around the world . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses 英年早逝 creativity is always the case of before . 
even if the suicide , they don &apos;t even out of that talent , no more often than not , they have a talent . 
and before he died , 曼梅 in the last time I said , in every single one of the “ 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , it &apos;s such a radical . 
I want to ask is , in the room , you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask is , in the room , you are no dispute about that ? 
you think this ? no problem , even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in species . 
it &apos;s not only 可憎 , and , I don &apos;t want to get up to the next century . 
it &apos;s not only 可憎 , and , I don &apos;t want to get up to the next century 可憎 , and it &apos;s not only that , I don &apos;t want to get up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses would live . 
and I myself , believed that I &apos;m going to be in the dark matter , due to myself , and I believed that I &apos;m going to be in the dark matter , especially , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was young , to 40 years old , and you see , I was young , 40 years old . 
the next 40 years , I have about my . 
and frankly , we see in this talk , and I say , and one of my friends , right , this is probably the most successful , I &apos;ve been . 
Oh my God , what is this idea . 
is this idea , which is on a 大清早 -- not to have a way , is this idea , who took a drink 大清早 -- not just the way back . I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to do what I want to go . I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
and in my mind , it seems to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological by writing , and I want to continue to have to create a psychological protection . 
in some way , I have to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for responses from the anxious , and I &apos;m writing is the response to this anxiety . 
and this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go back to the problem . 
and in the ancient Greek , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from humans , and in the ancient Greek , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from humans , and in the ancient Greek , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 and unknowable from far away to all the artists , with a remote and unknowable distant and no purpose to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called this to universal creativity , to come to the 精灵 stewards for “ ” 
and people often think that there &apos;s a Socrates stewards for wisdom , from a distance , and he was giving people think that general Socrates , a stewards for that gives him from a distance . 
people have similar to the point of view , they put this kind of creative genius “ ” 精灵 called the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” 
this is a good idea , because you don &apos;t think of genius “ ” is a particularly intelligent , the idea of Rome , wonderful , because people don &apos;t think ” “ genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what I was looking at this safe distance from work is to protect the 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
and by the artist . this is the narcissistic , by the ancient of artists and get it to protect narcissistic , too . 
if you work , that &apos;s a great success , because you can &apos;t , you know , you &apos;re in a kind of ” “ genius of the project . 
if you work a terrible , but not all of you . 
we all know that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad ” “ genius . 
this is in the Western for a long time to think about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he &apos;s otherwise completely normal to swallow in the sun , that &apos;s the individuals are vulnerable , so much . 
it completely down to one &apos;s perception , and for an individual . completely . it down to one &apos;s perception of people , and the great achievement . 
and I think that &apos;s the kind of stress , you get in the last 500 years , so I think that &apos;s an artist , this pressure , get in the last 500 years of artists . 
and if that is true of at least I think this is what we now the question is : how do we do ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : we do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the more reference for them to understand human creativity ? maybe we should go back to the past , the more reference for them to understand human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes that incorporate 500多年 out of the reason we can &apos;t use a human mind , the question-asking in 18 minutes , just out of the human mind 500多年 rational . 
and maybe , you have to convince you that I couldn &apos;t agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but , I mean , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any of you who &apos;ve tried to make you believe that there had been through this process will know that &apos;s not always rational . 
and in fact , the creative process , which is a common , and beyond 
it &apos;s like , on the Mall , really , and the next to her . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing is to really dashed across “ ” 
on the other , and this is called me the most amazing : in other parts of the time , this is the most amazing part , called me and she said , there are almost 错过 poem . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , a poem by a tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry on paper 誊写 
and this will intact , poetry , which is just a piece of paper , from the upside down in the last word go by , and after the first words . 
I heard this story , and she was like , this is incredible , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of the creative process , and I &apos;m not a pipe , and so much more like a . 
but even 古板 , and I would like to get the idea of an accident , but even 古板 , sometimes I get inspired by accident . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people like this . 
you want to 墨守成规 , even if people like me , and you have to know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , and you have to know where inspiration . 
what was going on here ? 
in how we &apos;re going to look at it , not rational ? we have lost in how to look at it , not to do good ? 
he wanted to capture it badly , but there is no way , he didn &apos;t pen and paper , there are a tape recorder , and he wanted to capture it , but there is no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder pen and paper . 
no , I &apos;m “ I don &apos;t do ” 
suddenly , he had to go on a weird panic and emotions , impatience and do something unusual . 
suddenly , he had to go on a weird panic and emotions , impatience and do something unusual weird things suddenly , he had to continue to grab a impatience and emotions , and do something unusual . 
and he looked for it to the sky , say , you can &apos;t see “ sorry , I was driving ? he ” looking for it to the sky , say , you can &apos;t see “ sorry , I &apos;m ” driving ? 
and he looked for it to the sky , say , you can &apos;t see “ sorry , I was driving ? I looked like ” immediately you can get a piece of that look like ? 
if you really want to pick out in the world , and the right time , I come in handy , if you really want to pick out in the world , and the right time , I come back in time . 
today , or you can go and find other people , to bug 莱昂纳德 / 科恩 to 
today , or you can go and find other people , to bug 莱昂纳德 / 科恩 to 
since that happened , you change the whole process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , he still is completely dark . 
he can inspiration , and this is the unknown , between the weird and wonderful relationship with his inspiration , and this is the unknown , between the weird and wonderful , that &apos;s a relationship of itself . 
the story of pernicious and changing the way I work , and it has saved me this story to potentially socially isolating yourself the change the way I work , and it has saved me . 
and it &apos;s not just the worst , shit , I think I should give up to write this book . 
and it &apos;s not just the worst , shit , I think I should give up to write this book . 
and I came to my God , shouting and Tom , and then I tried to try and I think of the day , Tom shouting that , and then I tried to . 
and I looked up from the manuscript , to a room of the manuscript from space , and I looked up to one of the room . 
“ because you can see , I have no effort put towards ” “ ; you can see , because I have no effort put towards the ” . 
if you want to “ this book is better , it &apos;s now your turn that part of them , do you ” work . 
if you don &apos;t “ to help you , it &apos;s just to see the ” . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to continue to write down , because it &apos;s my job . &quot; 
I hope that the historical record , I hold 尽责 jobs , and perhaps today , I hope that the historical record , and I hold 尽责 jobs . 
the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer and the professional performing a wonderful , wonderful , because they are a professional dancer . 
occasionally , though , there &apos;s actually going to happen , but one thing was going to go beyond the 出世 . 
you know , I should say that because you &apos;ve all seen , in that moment . 
time , it seems to stop . stop through time , it seems like a dancer , through what he did a performance and 1000场 before , and all the different , and amazingly , it together . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human life , from the inside of the light from the bottom of light . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human life , the light from the inside , and he &apos;s coming from the bottom of the sacred shine . 
clearly , people know what it is , they can make it was called the name of the people , to know what it is , they can name it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
when one performer in Spain , it was a kind of amazing people are going to give you all are cheering you on your way , Alabama , “ 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , Alabama , really , really great , great . that &apos;s incredible miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , is the dancer and the next morning , 悠悠 artists , turn to wake up in the morning , the dancers around that 悠悠 awake at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning is , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and that was just a bad leg , the older people are going to go for it , and he couldn &apos;t do that in the last night . 
and he was never going to dance with all are cheering you on your way miracles , since he was going to do ? 
this is a very smart questions , and it &apos;s in my perception of one of the most painful . 
this is a very smart questions , and it &apos;s in my perception of one of the most painful , and this is a very smart questions , and it &apos;s in my perception of one of the most painful . 
but maybe we don &apos;t have to , so that if you were never thought of art , and that is starting from you , if you were never thought of art , and that is starting from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
don &apos;t fear , “ . you just have to do good ” that part of the work . 
don &apos;t fear , “ . you just have to do good ” that part of the work . 
hold in your , whatever you , what are jobs , and if you are , it &apos;s dancing . 
hold in your , whatever you , what are jobs , and if you are , it &apos;s dancing . 
if you didn &apos;t , so you hold on to dance , jobs for you , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
if you didn &apos;t , so you hold on to dance , jobs for you , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you know , 嘞 ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists think more than a tendency to worry about that , and he ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos of the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the past , the size of South America by a 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but this is not a question of this , because this is not one of the ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the heart of the climate system . 
the heart , in the summer , and actually hyperextending . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is a permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s a year in the dark blue is this ice formed in the context of the Year in the summer ice was freezing . 
what was freezing “ ” context , I &apos;m talking about five or more , and you can see the ice , and it &apos;s like to 各部 blood , a body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect of the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a huge amount of carbon by was freezing . and the microbes 干冰 defrost clean , methane , carbon . 
now , if the top of the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of the global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska , you can see , in the lake has been a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the professor alaska katey walter 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , a lot of heat the heat of the Greenland . 
the last year , this is a river . 
but 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the ice is sea level rise to the mouth of the Nung here is it . 
here &apos;s the traffic is rising . 
the other side of the Earth , the ice of the planet . 
and last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and a few below sea level is accelerating the melting . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest himalayas in ice , you can see at the top of the lake , and it &apos;s just a few years ago , ice . 
40 percent of the world for the water from being half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of the ice , drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry more numbers . 
and the number of the world in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of the first four times more 七十五年 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the last five years we increase the ocean 两千五百万吨 七千万吨 carbon dioxide , carbon dioxide emissions . 
watch the Pacific , from the east to west of India , in the ocean and dramatically reduce both . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
the world &apos;s largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a used to use more carbon in the coal . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see the change of the ocean . 
this is what has and some of the new green alternative . 
so it , but there &apos;s a political in our country . 
coal oil industry , and carbon in the last year , and it took to promote 两千五百万美元 clean coal . it &apos;s too . 
that &apos;s what I remembered . 
before Christmas , Tennessee , in my hometown of billions of dollars to the muck up the coal . 
you can see on the news . 
here &apos;s the second largest , the waste , put it up . 
and this happens to the Christmas 
there &apos;s one of the carbon -- coal and advertising . 
coal to happiness , and that &apos;s cool . 
in the United States , you can see him , he was productive , more productive and economic development . 
and in the coal cool every day , more healthy . 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of virginia west , where the coal . 
there &apos;s the head of the coal mining massey 
so this is the work of people -- and now , one of the project launched two . 
this is one of the part of one of them . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal , and the coal mining version of it . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , is it smells good quality . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s do it . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art clean coal , like the factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but this is the clean coal . 
and the coal burning global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here is the technology that fascinated clean coal changed everything . 
let &apos;s look today . this is a clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and the challenge . 
in the United States , the economic crisis , the climate crisis . 
all of these strings of crisis is based on carbon , like the dirty oil dependency on imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve the problem . 
clean america repower with 100 percent of the last 10 years . 
the new work , we have to get a better life , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america know more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about america repower . 
in the old oil and dirty murder , this is our planet , let &apos;s cut on the other way . 
in the future . here &apos;s the wind , solar energy , a new network . 
the investment to create a new kind of work . 
has repower america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you &apos;re going to go quickly , independent . 
if you &apos;re going to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to go far , and it is . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables -- to show you a toy . 
first of all , I want you to think about as you play in the building blocks . 
and when you go to the building block , and how to do with it , and you &apos;re learning how to solve the problem is this object is to understand and 空间结构 . 
to understand the very 空间结构 that helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
so the question of , I would keep in mind , so we decided to find the answer , so it &apos;s siftables . 
basically , which is a siftable interact with a computer , it &apos;s like the crackers . 
you can move siftables with each other , 每块 siftable perception of each other , and 每块 siftable monitor and radio device . 
the most important thing is , it &apos;s 每块 siftable , like , can block . 
and for a new siftables ecosystems -- this is the digital information . 
this individual tools , more and more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , so we can use these interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
it &apos;s the reflection siftable , if I put it on one side to it , so that in this picture , and if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images , in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put out a 挨 , an interesting thing is going to happen . 
if you put a bunch of them , they will be aware of it , and that &apos;s kind of chaos . 
they can move each other and feel . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like that , for example , the colors down from a liquid into another siftable siftable . 
so we look at this , it &apos;s in three siftables barrels of oil paint patterns , we can put into the barrel of color in the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
and if it , it can go back . 
and siftables machine learning of language , can be used to wait , the arithmetic -- we want to get through these functions , to see it faster . 
and that &apos;s what I &apos;m here to siftables -- and the reason it &apos;s a simple equation , I made of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables . she can play together and boggle scrabble -- a kind of a game . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable dollars , and when you put them together siftables letters of the words in the dictionary , the siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically spell on the right word that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
so it . thank you very much . 
so now , some of the screen in the Media Lab siftables experience in the use of the kids , and I put the experience . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word “ ” together , they know how to do that . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the lower right . this is the age . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learning the language of the people . 
this is the child Felix . 
he could use some new graphics to add elements , what he did was put on the table , towards the siftables pick up some graphics , you can put it to the new element . 
see , he put up the sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David and put it in . 
in the orange one . 
do good . 
siftables to shake the graphics just , you can add elements to this new , he added new elements -- the dog 吠 up . 
he was writing a story of his animation . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plan , his story . 
the balloon down off . 
I &apos;m going to show you one last in this feature , playing music is even more recently , we &apos;ve developed in the function of siftables , to sound like a drum and 超载 note , and the sound . 
every tiles , had to regulate 四档 任君 choice . 
you can think of the sound of the modules siftable to sound editors siftable tiles on the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a 响器 , with the filter and siftable module . 
this kind of sound to come close to the tiles that you can adjust to sound . 
and then you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume of the modules siftable siftable come close to adjust the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two tiles 超载 into edit , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums , so that it can adjust tiles . 
I &apos;m going to accelerate the pace of tiles that just come close to the rhythm . 
now , and the filter and come close to turn a tiles . 
music playing in the process , we can do . 
so don &apos;t even starting to play , but it &apos;s based on a long time , but it &apos;s short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with the volume , to come with tiles on the left , the place . 
so it . thank you very much . 
and as you see , I was able to develop a new kind of human-computer interaction with the brain , the better . 
today , I &apos;ll show you the next siftable , we are going on in the lab . 
I want to talk to you in the idea is that we developed a new generation of combining cutting-edge technology -- and the digital media 接轨 technology to bring to the world , and it &apos;s going to change in the innovation that we &apos;re going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
