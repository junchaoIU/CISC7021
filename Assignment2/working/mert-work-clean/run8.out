rapture , through photos and stories , for National Geographic , the explorers by Wade Davis celebrate culture indigenous people around the world extraordinary , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate disappear from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same kind of adaptive rules . 
we all was born in the world and 母腹 生儿育女 
we &apos;re going to experience the adult week showered . 
have to deal with the brutal 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 排遣 苦楚 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find the culture of songs rhythm and pace of the unique identity with dance 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you can now send this thinking will let you see the future . 
the world of cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by a mental life and culture interwoven into life and the Internet cover the entire planet Earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the ecology . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , which is very strong , as we have the ability to look at the species . 
by the biosphere as big as the race is facing the same end of the destruction , and it faster . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s actually in the spirit of the unique culture in the material world 承 therapy . 
each one is a language , a conscious mind with a mental ecosystem long-term precipitation and accumulate . 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language and the number of our audience as many of these languages in half no longer have to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 effective rules that act , unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky on Earth is about every two weeks , you will have to be a 仙逝 with an ancient is the language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore this race to loop loop , race , you know , a rough and make you personally feel are die civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I said “ different way of living ” I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 Bala pull the areas that they &apos;re called 蚺 because they believe in a race of the fabled 米尔克 coming from the river that they were born in the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t distinguish between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 their so in the forest canopy with no difference . 
they said , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 called 异族 linguistics 通婚 one to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this is based on through the history of mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador race to the most amazing 华拉尼 is one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five year 1957 missionaries trying to get these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air , eight to 十张 pictures of himself , and we think it &apos;s friendly means , but they don &apos;t think these live in the water regulation by rainforests , who had never seen pictures of two-dimensional 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use 戮 with this missionary five died . 
it &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 戮 external die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population of death by their own 戮 dead people . 
we investigate some 一个八代 宗谱 两例 found only natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the same old people being the wood is going to do , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing forest 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand the secret I have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo taught how to teach a voodoo is the magic of darkness . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if I want you to list some important in the world of religion that will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about life , and it &apos;s the connection between them . 
in living soul . 
the dance 大水 to tap the rhythm can replace temporary soul of living soul in this brief shining moment for 侍僧成 gods . 
so , voodoo believers , like to say , you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
I &apos;ve been exposed to all of the community that lives in the mountains in northern Columbia Santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is a race tyranny ancient civilization , they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of a plain isolated mountains . 
in this bloody ethnic continent globe that have never been to the Spaniards . 
and today , they will monk 续 along with the ruling institutions , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
they like 母腹 back groups are taught the values that maintain is these values , and with the relationship between the believers in the universe , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you want to protect it . 
they call us lies call myself for over , we are in the world . 
this is very important , the ability to learn intuition . 
it &apos;s not going to indigenous 多愁善感 would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be the deforestation . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this picture last year I was in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent dopamine color of the components of it , and within the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people will have from serotonin , plants extract and continuing with this substance nose . 
if you use a nose inhale the powder that you can see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not , it &apos;s twisting 荡然无存 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine change . 
these color dopamine to oral substance to have a single change oral 氧化酶 dopamine , and the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in 藤本植物 β 咔 啉 -- there was going to be able to control 氧化酶 dopamine agonists color and play the potency of everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
we ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments mistake repeatedly measure it . 
but if you ask Indians will say they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people die in the cane is all in the deep jungle , they found that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to a hierarchy is how these plants , they said , &quot; I want you to have some plants . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , and I said , is not understand . 
so I tell you , if they said in the months of the circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem that although our compassion , some of the indigenous people had thought 离群索居 enrich their lives , but as we world forward . these people in the back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been influenced by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with interest is still Indians and American horse and carriage to sit still lives in the United States . 
the threat race intact layer is not change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we look at in Tibet recently where I do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide endangered cultures , which is the destruction of the people lifestyle crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of the praise by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of withstand Tibet 
this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
China , he immediately after the invasion of people were killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together into Nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family is locked up right here , and then when you sit down . 
and he was only two of his mother , his quietly in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister , because the behavior , and just by 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of 臂章 and being in the crosshairs of 劳教 for seven years . 
the pain of Tibet elusive human spirit bear redemption need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve existed drained 60 and make us feel guilty . 
新石器 into an agricultural revolution of human time , we would like to these seeds 腊 萨满 Beijerinck poetry is the rabbi . after all , we created the level of 社会分工 it only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society will only last 三百年 history . 
in my view this brief history was enough to have the ability for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
when we went to the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully realize species that we have to make sure that all the race , and all of life 昌盛 prosperity . 
this picture was taken in the north of 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the 1950s Canada government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign away , and we &apos;re going to settlement . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family , and he worried about the safety of all the weapons , and he took tools . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the advantage of God , thick . 
they sledge across the street in North America 鹿皮 caribou package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear of the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside , wearing his seal 长裤 he took skin to shit faster shit until fingers stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 after freezes it becomes very robust after he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
the skin peel dog made out of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds and condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t get the shit knife made in on the ice . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 life becomes real . 
1999 four months of government to Canada than the size of Texas and California 之和 larger land returned back to the Inuit people . 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions Le non-Inuit Lesters 
this is a independent territory , where they control all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think for ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of our people dream of these kids with our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a National Geographic and TV can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about the fact that we can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on a website to thousands of three , five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of readers magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera Y arcas . in this stunning photosynth demo , the software that could change the way we watch . using digital images from the static pick photosynth stunning photos , created the scenes , and we can navigate the dream . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of our digital photographs , they can continue to zoom in , and the full by the way you can look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
see , no matter how many of the data sets , images , how big and image how big seadragon itself , and have this ability to deal with . 
so most of the picture was taken by a digital camera , but this is a picture of it , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it doesn &apos;t look at what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just , you can use the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it is the data images . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I gave you that this is really text and the images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
so this is a more practical , this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture of opening did . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people would get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we made small change in The Guardian issues that to the corner . 
we fictional a high-resolution picture advertising than normal -- that you see an average of high resolution , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , and you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
in a certain way on the screen to avoid the actual use . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve created this field of our contribution . 
these were just at NASA geospatial basis . 
and that &apos;s overlaid on with the road map of the United States . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different kinds of technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other recognizes from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely computer vision of what the research . this research , Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Rick Institute of szeliski . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied , it &apos;s based on building seadragon technology . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way we looked for images , and can communicate much more nuanced and have at the resolution browsing experience . 
but these images , in the space is actually a very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples , the more interesting than this space . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by 串联 in this space . 
and then , we can so easily go to . 
DH : be honest , I never thought I would come and work for Microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see the original these images from a lot of different camera phone camera , from a single professional to the . so a lot of different picture of quality , in this environment into building . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 shine , etc . 
I remember here , there should be a sequence of images -- ah , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
so the important point here ? is effectively , we can use the Internet community . we can start to get everybody &apos;s data about everybody different memories of the environment , collect together to build models . 
and when all of these pictures are intertwined , a much more than just to collect all up . 
what this model menacing , is the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like , &quot; The Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth &apos;s long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , you will be on in . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from a global 接合 pictures together ? 
that is meaningful . this software is to explore . 
it builds up in the middle picture hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on the content of the picture . 
the more exciting is that contains images of text semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type , on the web to have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , with all these pictures of your image , it will ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s incredible ! you congratulate . 
thank you very much . 
the Arabic 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I want to here to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of these things resonate with that , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I think of a credo . 
what kind of principles ? 
the whole industry is Western society , not by 笃信 a credo . 
this is a credo say : if we allow people to get big benefits , the way it is to maximize to individual liberty . 
and the reason is free , with this stuff is beautiful , to value , for people . 
and once people have freedom , each of us can 做主 ourselves with all sorts of ways to get the benefits , people don &apos;t have to 做主 for me . 
the freedom to be a way that &apos;s the selectivity increases . 
people more choice is freedom , freedom , more and more and more of it . 
I think , this idea , like so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in that nobody wanted to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas and deep embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of contemporary look at the progress of social development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say here ingredients salad . 
you see , this is the supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional sound system -- speaker , a CD , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores do one in stereo system is countless more . 
with components of this store , you can have 650万种 close out all the combination of the three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , it &apos;s got to go Bell Maya , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually died at the phone , it &apos;s not all bad . 
the days 一去不返 already . 
now I have almost infinite variety of cell phone , especially . that . 
these are the cell phone . 
and I love most in the middle -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , nose cutting hair and French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next seen shops , don &apos;t worry , I don &apos;t use it , you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : there you have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in the lives of more than other shopping for us , and the effect of the Big Bang . 
the health care -- in the United States , now that is not to see your doctor , who tells you how to do so time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use nail treatment , can also use 乙 solution . 
there are very nail solutions , and so forth and risk . 
and so forth , and very 乙 solutions are at risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , how do I do ” ? 
doctors said these are nail , again , risk , and very 乙 have the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re me , that you chose ” ? 
the psychiatrist says , but I don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now the prescription for advertising , all of the drugs that these people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said isn &apos;t . and since we buy directly to the counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they hoped that we see in the morning after advertising would go to the doctor to call your doctor , put on a prescription drugs with them . 
now as our identity , gender , this kind of thing became a choice . it &apos;s like trying to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , and it was invented by myself . 
so we can get back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of men and women are the decision . 
in the family marriage , everybody in the past . it &apos;s almost like age married , and then of course , is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I was married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all the things you can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart magnificant students , but now I give them a round of working than less than one fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they students than ever before -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself : what I should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and then I was trying to kids , let &apos;s first career knew ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not do I do homework , whether they &apos;re also in my class . take a grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology , we can make progress in any one time , in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , there &apos;s a place of WiFi can , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I also want to use . 
and we work with these incredible freedom of choice for us is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 with the BlackBerry blackberry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the same rivals for kids in constantly ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick up the phone ? 
go back to this email or not ? should I wrote this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no child , you know , this is the experience of the game is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big , of the matter is lifestyle , lifestyle choice is . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but it &apos;s not have nothing to choice . 
and today &apos;s world we live in . 
the problem is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
one , and he said something like an oxymoron , which is , we have to choose . it &apos;s not , but inside , is paralysis . 
so with many choices that people want to make a decision , very difficult . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan to wait pension in terms of investment . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest in vanguard . vanguard is a tremendous peer fund companies , have about a million employees and two , 000多个 office . 
she is , when surveyed the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of species increases every 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to decide that it &apos;s even more difficult choice , so you just put and tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow halide tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
don &apos;t join the plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so many possibilities , choice is the result of paralysis . 
it makes us into this world -- like this slide . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose a wrong fund , or salad ingredients . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
choice , more easily inexplicably something to feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction to make choices . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a is enough , we see a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you pick up a fascinating aspect of it . that makes you always was chosen for you to think that 美中不足 . 
so , for example , but it didn &apos;t have that , if you are not the New York , I &apos;ll 歉 a dish . 
but this is what you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
you can still better than this ? this is in this to “ huh , really , bad ” “ now is , in August ” . 
“ Manhattan neighbors ” at all . 
“ is I &apos;m going to stop that can go back to my door ” . 
for two weeks , and he was such an idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the parking . 
the opportunity cost “ ” always has enabled us to make decisions , even with enough to actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of that , these things are the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also says a “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but , one of the truth is , when you choose to do something that , you have chosen not to do other things . 
these other things tend to have a lot of you decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I have to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans , that &apos;s a pattern , you buy back , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to wash after several times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , this is a years old , and finally , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and you &apos;re going to say , the type of comfort , and the sweatpants ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
to quickly that grinds them ? 
and the mouth , and the isolated ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw almost off . and when I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to that is only one was ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I spent a 钟头 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , I took a place that I most 合身 pants stores out the door . 
I do not really wrong . those choices that I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there is felt worse . 
why ? it , and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse reason is , because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a much better jeans , what should be greatly good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least the economy is a perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I took that I &apos;ve got to go and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives , together , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of other people don &apos;t have many benefits . 
just bring it to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
the market , there &apos;s nobody to know the truth . because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what it is . I mean , I mean . 
it &apos;s like this , but in comics , in all the bad things are better than now . 
when one of the reason is that people do not have good experience to be some surprises . 
now , those of us in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
you &apos;ll never be what surprises , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time to talk about myself , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing on my 凑合 , no , I do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are in store for you in jeans hundreds of choice , you buy a back , and not feel happy , and you ask , why , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
out there on the jeans hundreds of excuses , you don &apos;t make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even when the result of that decided to do is they &apos;re very good to be disappointed . , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and the explosive growth is clinically depressed . 
and finally , the net effect is , even though the objective , we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this brought to the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice , better than no choice , but it can &apos;t just choose predictions are more is better . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ ’ richer we choose to value the key . 
I said . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many choices , is a material . 
the world , there &apos;s a lot of places , at least , we heard a few of them , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies on a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us from not as before . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of us , like the plague of extra choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position of intelligence , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting that &apos;s when I read . 
but I want to feel more clearly this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish and -- for this fish , maybe a little bit , for us , almost certainly is too small . 
but , don &apos;t have a fraction of the fish , which means to be suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code in biology , to a new design , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , I think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the tiny components . 
now , almost 20 years , we &apos;ve used it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it &apos;s the world from analog in biology , computer analysis September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can life , or whether we went from the digital world can create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome in the lab , we can make it replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from 500组 一百组 genes that we make these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its component of questions to continue the basic problem . 
so we started to walk along this path “ , we can synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we &apos;ve never done molecules displayed ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life constantly exponential rate and speed . 
our genetic code to write the ability to progress very slow , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago , we started this work . 
in fact , it took me through the stages . we do in the first trial ago , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a process , the decline of the fragments , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first try Phi X 174 , from the genome of phage and digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it pieces of genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
another phase of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live of chemicals , put it into the bacteria bacteria started reading the genetic code , made the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill a different 兰氏 E. coli and cholera negative . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , and I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud of more than you . 
so we think this is actually the software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that these numbers to accurate information . 
when we first in 1995 for this group of subjects , gene sequencing is basically every 10,000 for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to , on average , 30 is wrong . if we use the genetic sequence , this group would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the other 50 character long overlaid clip to build smaller units of time . we need to design , they can together . 
one of the design of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
you see the genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , we didn &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments enzyme which cuts bias . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to make 24 , 1,800,000 character and fragments of length of time out into the merger 72 , and fragmented . 
at every stage , we produce a lot of these fragments sequence , so we can give them , because we want to create a very reliable process , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very big more than 100 , 10,000 to basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology , to repair the DNA , it can put together fragments 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a microbial called resistant to be able to withstand 三百万度 球菌 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , the before . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule microscopic images . through the process , which is what the yeast , and the way we design and put it right . they automatically yeast aggregates . 
this is not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just a regular optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
these are long , about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open trials recently . 
this is more than 580000 character long gene code . this is not by humans setting the structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do very simple , a more complicated . 
do we really like that nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a tucked into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you heard about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell cells to another and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process that is , but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that all accepted second chromosome from other species or chromosome , the third place in a second increased thousands and thousands of new features to its own . 
people who were all the time in the process of evolution , just a genetic change ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called enzyme limits to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of the cells have this kind of enzyme enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it &apos;s a performance , and recognize the chromosome is a external matter , it &apos;s to digest , finally , we have a new contain DNA cells . 
we put into the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put on the cell “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are membrane changed , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , in fact , it is that we will implant . 
it may sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on the evolution of 3.5 billion years . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
I think for some reason , we need to do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world into a three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , within four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , all the fuel , very difficult . 
which 捉襟见肘 that &apos;s nine billion people . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature programs can replace or any of it , it would be a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that all of this material was in the atmosphere of CO2 emissions . 
and we found from around the world , there &apos;s a database of 两千万组 about genes , and I like to call them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now , our main limitation from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because these can make we call the mixing “ ” group of synthetic quickly . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can live in the ability to choose , chemical production , or the fuel produced vaccines , and so forth . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that some work that we actually sit in the computer to really design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad trial . 
soon we will have a second and third is sugar . into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide -- it &apos;s one way . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling the water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to collect their , and then they &apos;re very convenient can be introduced into , with fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we did the whole oil industry , with a little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there might be a major ? pollution-free . 
and we also use the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you see all of this year &apos;s flu , we always have to slow down for a year on time and money in the absence of the useful when the vaccine . 
I think this can be created by mixing vaccine was to change . 
this is the future might change the situation , accompanied , as the evolutionary tree , artificial bacteria have such an artifact for the last thing is true of nuclear biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox which shares some super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : what the LHC out ? 
last year at TED , I introduced the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to talk to update it in the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year to the LHC in history , is the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
used to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the mechanical underground in Geneva 
we use these little changes to probe the Big Bang . 
this is the inaugural I work on , ATLAS . detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas process of building magnificent scale , you can see huge . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas of the photos . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first picture clusters of particles around the LHC along the way we plan , as part of the LHC , with a lot of particles in the heat 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know , this is a 满堂喝彩 is this -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with a shock culture , and it &apos;s the same shock . 
but about a week later , we machine out of a major 导线 with these about -- the gold 导线 . 
these 导线 conduction 安培 current when they all machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , these wires ” too little . 
they can do because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so in the planet below minus 271摄氏度 between the temperature of the space of these cases 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a world 接点 install technology , there &apos;s a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to a little bit more of the transmission it suddenly 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnets up the material they move about a mile rule . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
must unloaded , put them down , the work has accomplished . 
we gave them joy , it &apos;s good . 
now just waiting for them back to the ground . 
in about three of the LHC refer to be 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data and continue our mission to find out the universe , the most basic units . 
now obviously , so one of these accidents back about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still in the pursuit of projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
thank you .

however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event , however , recently , in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where I know , people think that this is my life as a result , no matter where I now , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very quickly to worry about , and I said , “ . don &apos;t you ? don &apos;t be afraid that you are not beyond that book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was met around the same question , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid to continue to collapse on you ? 
you end up in the fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , I was always get questioning , etc . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
actually , except that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t think that this actually , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
let &apos;s say the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people are afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logical ? people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logical ? 
nobody said , &quot; John , chemical “ work ? I met a bottleneck ” ? 
could never ask this happened . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , isn &apos;t that a group in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and global , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 gently is often die of suicide .

Noam 曼梅 , before he died in the last one interview I said , “ every book 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
and for your work life , it &apos;s such a radical . 
today I want to ask is : the room , you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask is : the room , you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of the outside in

this view , and not only 可憎 horrible , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century 可憎 , not only that , and horrible , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses continue to be alive . 
and I myself , believed that I &apos;m going to be in the dark matter , due to myself , and I believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years career . 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , and I said , quote , friends , and the heart , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , this is the idea of what ! 
is this idea , who took a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . is this idea , who took a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to keep doing what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to keep doing what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deep in my view , to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanism . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from extreme anxiety writing itself , and I work for extreme anxiety received . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go around the back . 
in the ancient Greek and Ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and Ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and Ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called in common with this kind of creative 精灵 ” stewards for “ for it . 
when people think pervasive -- Socrates stewards for this is from a distance , and gives him general wisdom was that people think there &apos;s a -- Socrates stewards for wisdom gives him from a distance . 
Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent personal view of this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is just , this is what I &apos;m looking for that is to make this safe distance from people who work on protecting the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , isn &apos;t it ? 
artist ancient by this idea , and get protection of the ancient artist narcissistic by this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass “ ” geniuses work done . 
if you work really bad , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ ” genius , very bad . 
this is in the last Westerners for a long time about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
this is a completely distorted the cognitive self , and for people to make this incredibly thoroughly . this is a perversion of cognitive self , and for people to expand the great achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artist is I think this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artists . 
if this is really , at least I think that this is the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to their reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to reference for them to understand human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking in the developed 500多年 rational human mind , we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
so , maybe I can &apos;t convinced you agree with me . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you all had this experience of the creative process will know it doesn &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
like on a breath of emptying down her face . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with the only thing she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part of something , and she said she has almost 错过 poem . 
and then she would take the other hand , grab a poem that tail to get it back on the other hand , it will 誊写 poetry on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the last word go by , after all , the word . 
I heard her story , I thought : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my work is so much more like the way . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get the idea of an accident , but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get the idea of an accident .

clearly , people know what it is , they can call it the name was clearly , people know what it is , they can call out of it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
in Spain , when a performer done some incredible wondrous , people will give you all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , really , really great , excellent . that &apos;s miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 artists to wake up , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 awake at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , that is , he &apos;s no miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old mortals , maybe , and he couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe he &apos;ll never somebody dance all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should since ? 
this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful cognitive of self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creation of self , one of the most painful cognitive , this is a very tricky issues creative process , which is the most painful cognitive of self . 
but maybe , we have been so painful , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , you do that part of the ” work . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , you do that part of the ” work . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs , what is : if you are , it &apos;s dancer dance . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs , what is : if you are , it &apos;s dancer dance . 
if you didn &apos;t , it &apos;s continue dancing , hold your jobs for you , I still you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
if you didn &apos;t , it &apos;s continue dancing , hold your jobs for you , I still you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
嘞 you ! 
from Al Gore here at TED , a new situation , the global climate trend that scientists are worth more than the predictions about that , and he for “ ” clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I was about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the area of by the equivalent of South America 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but this is not a question of this , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the global climate system beating heart 
the winter and summer actually hyperextending heart heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is a permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter , and this is a form of the Year in summer , ice permanent ice was freezing . 
the so-called “ permanent ” was freezing , I &apos;m talking about five or more form of ice , you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
that &apos;s worth of the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and by the letter was freezing . 干冰 defrost , methane , carbon clean from microbes . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s OK , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a river melting every year . 
but 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest Greenland kangerlussuaq river . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
here is a dramatic rise in traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the Earth on this planet , the largest ice . 
and last month , scientists are in the entire continent report to reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world to get water from its molten half of the water . 
in the ice , the Andes , this is the city drinking water . 
in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you see , is very serious . 
the world in a fire and dry to dramatically increase the numbers . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , a disaster in relation to the number four 七十五年 earlier . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the past five years we added CO2 every 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions from the ocean . 
watch the areas from the east to west of the Americas in India on the continent dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
the oil is very important , the most urgent coal . 
the world &apos;s largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what some of the has and some new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 appeal to clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of what . 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee dig billions of muck up the coal . 
you may have seen in the news . 
here , there &apos;s the second largest waste , put up . 
this is before Christmas . 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see more productive , and he also help us about the economic development . 
coal Mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here is west virginia , where a lot of coal . 
the most is the head of mining coal massey 
so the Alliance Al Gore and climate protection is one of the current and work on two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s the smell of clean . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a normal clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but this is the sound of clean coal technology . 
although burn coal , global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
well let &apos;s look ! this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security challenges . 
in the United States economic crisis , national security , climate crisis 
all these crisis strings together is based on our carbon oil products , like the dirty on imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
repower america clean electricity with 100 percent of the last 10 years in time . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty in the murder of our planet , and this is for us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
in the future . here , the wind , solar energy , new network . 
new investment to create something more money . 
repower has america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want to please recall a time , if you played kit . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is the object 空间结构 to understand and perception . 
to understand the object 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
so the question of , I would keep in mind , so we decided to find answers , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable was a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
siftables can use my hands , just 每块 siftable can perceive moves , each one of the 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
this individual more tools , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any moving subtle , so we can use this tool to try to some new interesting interaction . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
this is like siftable reflection configuration , if I put it side to it , so in this picture shows it , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they are a resounding 挨 , a really interesting phenomenon will happen . 
if they have a bunch of , and they would also be aware of , that would have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other and perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , for example , down to a liquid that color , from a siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s three paint patterns in the bucket siftables , we can put these bucket pour the color of the middle of the color , which together . 
if , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions , on-the-spot learning to become more quickly see the results . 
this is also , I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable dollars , and when you put a letter of siftables together words , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put the letters in other words , new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so , now on the screen in the Media Lab . some kids are involved in the test siftables experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word games ” “ together , they know what to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new graphics to add elements , what he did was to the table siftables towards pick up some graphics , you can put these new add elements to animation . 
see , he put add up to the Sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now he put together in it . 
in orange . 
do good ! 
put siftables to shake graphics can make a new add elements to this new elements , he added up -- 吠 dog . 
he was writing a story of his animation . 
hello ! 
this is an open , in the end of the story of how he plan stories . 
the cat balloon sitting off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function , playing music is even more recently , we developed this function siftables in sound domain , can make like 超载 frequencies , the sound of drums and Bess . 
everybody has tiles that 四档 modulation , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable hit you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like 响器 with the sound filter , a siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control the master rhythm and volume edited tiles siftable to adjust the tiles siftable rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
started to get into 超载 note two editors , plus some tiles 超载 . 
now to join 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums , so you can adjust tiles . 
I &apos;m going to accelerate the pace of just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to put sound filter tiles , Bessel filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , or even again . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance , but in all playing based , but long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with tiles , the entire volume edited near tiles on the left , with the place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , my ideal is to develop a new medium for computer-human interaction better fit the human brain works . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation sophisticated technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology to bring the world , it would change this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
