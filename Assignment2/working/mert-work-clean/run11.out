rapture purpose and images through stories , by Wade Davis National Geographic explorers of the world to celebrate culture as the Native Americans , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience the adult showered would . 
you have to deal with the brutal 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find that every culture songs rhythm and pace of the unique identity with dance 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you will now , a different way of thinking that will let you see hope . 
the world of cultural 犹如 五彩缤纷 by mental life and culture , a life of the Earth is covered the whole network of the Earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the net . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity is very strong , as we have the ability to look at the species . 
as the biosphere by a different race are facing the same , the destruction of the end , and it faster . 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 kind of language . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s actually in the spirit of the unique culture in the material world 承 therapy . 
every kind of language , a conscious mind is a mental ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate . 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that number , and we all these different languages in half no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 effective rules that act , unless they &apos;re going to be completely gone . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , is a terrible about every two weeks on the planet &apos;s going to be a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore this race about race loop loop , you know , a rough and make you personally feel are lose civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I said “ ” in front of the survival of the different ways , I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 Bala Caesar pull 蚺 areas that they &apos;re called the race because they believe in a political 米尔克 coming from the river that they were born in the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t distinguish between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 their so in the forest canopy with no difference . 
they say , a strange language and follow a unique 通婚 通婚 异族 linguistics called rules that people have played with a different kind of language , married people . 
this is based on through the history of mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador race to the most amazing 华拉尼 is one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five years to missionary 1957 to these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air , eight to 十张 pictures of himself , and we think this is kind of , but they don &apos;t think these people live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through of trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use it with five missionary 戮 died . 
it &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 external 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people die . 
we investigate some 一个八代 宗谱 natural death , we found only 两例 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the more old people go to the wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing forest 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand the way I have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo taught how to teach isn &apos;t a voodoo the magic of darkness . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if I want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about it was born with the connection between . 
in living soul . 
the dance 大水 to tap the rhythm can replace temporary under the soul of the soul of the living in the short time for the shining 侍僧成 gods . 
so , voodoo who like to say you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
I &apos;ve been exposed to , in all of those groups of life in the mountains in northern Columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization , they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of isolated in a plain . 
in this bloody ethnic globe continent that has never been to the Spaniards . 
and today , they will monk 续 along with the ruling , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain is these values , and the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you want to protect it . 
they call us lies call myself for over , we are in the world . 
this is very important , the ability to learn intuition . 
it &apos;s not going to indigenous 多愁善感 思乡 would not suffer the torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship between people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be the deforestation . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this photo was me last year in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent component of the color dopamine it with the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people will have from serotonin , plants extract and continuing with this substance nose . 
if you use a nose swallows the powder , you &apos;ll see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s in front of you are not distorted 荡然无存 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine change . 
the color dopamine to oral substance , and there &apos;s going to change oral 氧化酶 dopamine live the rest of chemicals . 
this is interesting in 藤本植物 咔 啉 β -- there was going to be able to control 氧化酶 dopamine agonists color and play the potency of everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
we ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments repeatedly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask Indians will say they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people die in the cane is all in the deep jungle , they found that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to have some plants . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants , and I said , is not understand . 
I tell you that if they said in the months of the circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , even though we like some of the indigenous people think that they confront compassion 离群索居 enrich lives of the world forward , but as we develop these people in the back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been influenced by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with Indians interest is still the horse and carriage courtesy of life , and there &apos;s still in the United States . 
the threat race intact is not change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we look at in Tibet recently where I do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of people &apos;s lives by the way to not denounce crimes in many places it even as part of the strategy by praise . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet withstand 
this young man 班禅 喇嘛 皈依 father . 
the Chinese immediately after he was killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together into Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
he was only two years old , and he put his mother quietly in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister , and by the 学习班 offense behavior . 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of 臂章 and being in the crosshairs of 劳教 for seven years . 
the pain of Tibet elusive redemption through the human spirit that need to get witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 drained there and make us feel guilty . 
新石器 into an agricultural revolution of human time , we would like to seed Beijerinck 腊 萨满 poetry is the rabbi . we &apos;ve created for all of this just 社会分工 level 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society will only last 三百年 history . 
in my view of history and the short enough to have the ability for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully realize the species that we have to make sure that all the race , and all of life 昌盛 prosperity . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern part of the mountain 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about his grandfather was a legendary story . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , Canada government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
he worried about the safety of his family , he took all weapons and tools . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the thick of God . 
they sled of the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside in his skin his shit seal 长裤 to hand until shit faster stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 after freezes it becomes very robust after he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
the dogs bark peel 挽具 he made a chest made out of dog sleds condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t put that in the knife made of manure on the ice . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 becomes real life . 
1999 four months of government to Canada than the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions , New Le 
this is a independent territory , where they control all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do with it , to repair the relationship between the people . 
and finally , I think for ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think and argue is not to convince others , but we think about the fact that you can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on the website of the month of thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of readers magazine . 
thank you . 
the Y arcas blaise aguera photosynth demo of this stunning , the software that could change the way we watch . using digital images from the static pick photosynth created stunning photos , the dream , and can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of our digital photographs , and they can continue to the full can zoom in , by the way to look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
no matter how many of the data , see , there &apos;s a lot of pictures and images itself seadragon , have the ability to deal with this . 
so most of the picture is taken by a digital camera , but this is a picture of it , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just , you &apos;re using the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;ll show you that this is really text , images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical , this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture did starts . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we are doing this in a small change issues to &quot; The Guardian corner . 
we fiction a high-resolution picture advertising than normal -- that you see the normal high resolution advertising , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way to avoid the area of the actual use . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and the kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and on top of the United States , with the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go to experience . 
this project called photosynth , it &apos;s actually merging two different kinds of technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other , graduate students from the University of Washington noah snavely computer vision of what the research . this research , Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski help . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied , it &apos;s based on seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way to look for images , to be able to do more nuanced and have at the resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples , the more interesting than this space . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
DH : be honest , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see the original these images from a lot of different camera phone camera , from a single professional to the . so a lot of different quality in this picture , all together in the environment . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so forth . 
I remember here , there should be a series of photos -- ah , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get in to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
the point here ? is effectively , we can use the Internet community . we can start to get everyone to different data that everyone in the memory of the environment , collect together to build models . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all . 
this model menacing , what is the whole planet . 
this is like Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , you will be in the tag . 
thank you very much . 
if I understanding you right , the software is going to be in the next few years to come from the picture of the global 接合 together ? 
. this is actually the software is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this process of 接合 is based on the content of the picture completely . 
the more exciting is that contains images of text semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type of words , the web to have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , with all these pictures of your image , it would be ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise congratulate , so incredible ! you did . 
thank you very much . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I think from a solid credo . 
what kind of creed ? 
that &apos;s the entire industrial 笃信 Western society , not by a credo . 
this is a credo say this : if we want to get people to make the welfare state , its way is to maximize that individual liberty . 
and the reason is free , with this stuff is good , valuable , for people to . 
and once people have freedom , our own 做主 everyone can do with all the benefits , don &apos;t have to get people for 做主 . 
the freedom to be a way that &apos;s the selectivity of . 
the choice of the people , more and more freedom , freedom , getting more and more welfare state . 
I think , this idea , like so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in that nobody wanted to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of contemporary look at the progress of social development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say here salad ingredients . 
you see , this is a supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store to a three-dimensional stereo system -- and it includes a CD , blah , blah , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system is countless more . 
with this store , you can make the components of 650万种 closer together with the three-dimensional stereo system . 
you couldn &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and that is to Maya Bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die . 
the days 一去不返 already . 
now I almost infinite variety of cell phone , especially -- that cartoons . 
these are the future of the cell phone . 
and I love most in the middle -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , nose and French forming a brownish caramel cut hair 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen , don &apos;t worry , not how you will see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : you have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
the answer is no ” “ . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in some other lives more than a shopping thing for us , this effect on the explosion of choice . 
health care -- not in the United States , right now is that you go to the doctor , who do so , how do you tell the time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment nail , can also use 乙 solution . 
and so forth , and make a solution nail risk . 
and so forth , and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
again , the doctors said these are very nail 乙 risk , and there &apos;s the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re me , that you chose ” ? 
the psychiatrist says , but I don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now , those commercials , all of a prescription drugs , for these people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s said isn &apos;t . and since we buy directly to the counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call the doctor , on a prescription drugs in them . 
now , we like the gender of the identity of this thing into a choice . it &apos;s like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but to invented by myself . 
so we can get back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of women and men is the decision . 
in the marriage of families in the past , everybody &apos;s got married . this is the age of things , and then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart magnificant students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they students than ever before -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself : what I should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to the kids , and I knew business ? 
these are 脑筋 is the problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re still not do I do homework , whether they in my class and take a grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because this is something important question . 
now do work , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can in one day , any time in any one corner of the Earth -- this is , of course , a basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , where you can actually have a wireless Internet , but I &apos;m not going to tell you what . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I also want to use . 
we say , the incredible work that we have the freedom of choice is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now is to break moved . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 BlackBerry , with the blackberry lap , and still holding laptop . 
even if they closed , we are looking at the same rivals for kids in constantly ask yourself , or don &apos;t pick up the phone ? 
go back to this email or not ? should I wrote this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no child , you know , this is the experience of the game is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big material , it &apos;s way of life , life is choice . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not all nothing to choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we have to choose . it &apos;s not , but box , is paralysis . 
many choices that people have found a very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan for pension investment in terms of research . 
one of my colleagues had access to the vanguard of investment . vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office . 
she is , when surveyed the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of species increases every 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it &apos;s even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow halide tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
this is not to plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so many possibilities , choice is the result of paralysis . 
it makes us into the world looks like this and this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you really want you to make that decision is the right , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose wrong helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the easy inexplicably something to feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction of choice . 
and second , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a enough , we see is a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you pick up a fascinating aspect of it . that makes you always was chosen for you to think that 美中不足 . 
for example , and that cartoons , and if you don &apos;t is New York , I said , a 歉 
but this is what you want to be the right thing . 
look at these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it can be better than this ? this is where it was really bad , huh , “ ” “ ” now is , in August . 
“ Manhattan neighbors are not ” at home . 
I &apos;m going to “ is to stop that can go back to my door ” . 
for two weeks , and he was such an idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the parking . 
always let ” “ opportunity cost , we &apos;ve made a decision not happy , even if it actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things , and all the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but , of a truth is , when you choose to do something , you just have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing you tend to have a lot of places to decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I have to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to washed so many times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , this is wearing pants years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
the counter said , you have to type , the comfort of sweatpants , or is it ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
to quickly that grinds them ? 
and back , and the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw , almost off . and I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to that is used to be the only a ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I brought one of the most that I never 合身 pants out the door . 
I do not really wrong . these choices that I had the opportunity to do better . 
but you feel it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , the reason is because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a much better jeans , what should be raising a good expectations . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I had to take me to go and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in the lives of people together , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well people didn &apos;t give us beyond how many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not know the truth . because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what is this idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all the bad things are better than now . 
the reason is , when one of the things that are not good people could experience to some surprises . 
now , those of us in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
you &apos;ll never be what surprises , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time to talk about myself , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing , and I didn &apos;t 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are in store for you in hundreds of jeans , bought a back , you don &apos;t feel happy , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you have no excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good . disappointed , to decide to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and the clinical explosive growth is depressed . 
and finally , the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this choice about the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no better than no choice to this picture , but don &apos;t choose more is better . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ ’ we choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , give us the industrialized society , so many of the matter is a rich . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least , we heard a few of them , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated 于事无补 , is not a choice . 
they actually bring us . 
they actually makes us not from ago . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us , like plague of extra choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position of intelligence , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting that &apos;s when I read . 
but I want to feel more clearly this fish must know something about it . 
if you want to be honest , because everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the was paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish . and for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish , which means that suffering is going to , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome , and they found a new meaning . and the genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new phase , the design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , I think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it down to the tiny components . 
now we have almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it &apos;s the world from analog in biology , computer analysis September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can life , or whether we went from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome to make it replicate , in the lab , we &apos;re trying to understand . and if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from 500组 一百组 genes that we make these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to ask the basic problem . 
so we started to walk along this path , we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life in an exponential rate and speed . 
the ability to write our genetic code to progress very slowly , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it was for the first stage . in the experiment we did before , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline in the process , the more than that , the more it wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first from Phi X 174 , to try and phage genome to the digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
the other stages of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t live chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually the software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that these numbers to accurate information . 
in 1995 , when we first gene sequencing to this group of subjects , every 10,000 is a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to 30 , the average is wrong . if we use the genetic sequence , this group would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the other 50 character long footage of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
and one of the unique part of our design . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about the genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , this is a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments enzyme which cuts bias . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to make 24 , 1,800,000 character length of time and time getting out , people at the time . 
at every stage , we had these fragments of culture , so we can give them a sequence , because we wanted to create a very reliable process , you will see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 basic when they &apos;re hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology , to repair the DNA , it can put together than 
here &apos;s an example of a microbial called resistant to be able to withstand 三百万度 球菌 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , the original before . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule . these microscopic images , it &apos;s yeast mentioned in front of the way through , and we put it into the design of automatically yeast . they talk . 
this is not the electron microscope pictures ; it &apos;s just a regular optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
this is a long time 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than the genetic code 580000 character . it &apos;s made by humans setting , and the structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do a very simple more complicated . 
we deal with this really like a biological and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in the other cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought that just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species or places in the third chromosomes , within seconds the thousands and thousands of new feature to its own . 
people were held in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzymes are able to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of cells , the enzyme , no , no , this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
that &apos;s it , and recognize the chromosome is a external matter , it is to digest , finally , we have a new contain DNA . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put on the new software ” “ cells . 
all the proteins are membrane changed , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , in fact , it is that we will implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
I think , for some reason why we need to do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world &apos;s three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , become four . 
we provide the food for 65亿 , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people in a 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace or any of the program , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material in the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now have found from around the world in a database of 两千万组 about genes , and I like to call them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry , and look to components that can get diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because these can make we call the mixing “ ” group of very synthetic . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard . we can choose to survive , the ability to choose , chemical production , or the fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that we actually sit in the computer work really use software to design the design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code , they look like . 
we focus on the ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide -- it &apos;s one way . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane into the molecules of its energy source . 
if we look at the two to collect their , they really , really convenient that process , can be introduced into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we did with the whole oil industry a little good . so if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there might be a major ? the energy . 
and we also use the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you see this all the flu , we always have to slow down at the time of year , and lack of money , when the vaccine useful . 
I think this is by mixing vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , nuclear is really have such an artifact for the biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a farther away from improve human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough time , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox which super Collider shares some of the news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
in the last year at TED I introduced the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to talk to update it in the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in the universe reinventing the billionth of a second state per second , and began to make a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we use these little changes to probe the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas of the photos . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of the LHC along the way we plan , as part of the LHC , with a lot of particles in the heat 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know is that this is also a 满堂喝彩 -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of research on this , again , it &apos;s significant . 
but about a week later , we kind of machine out of the main with these 导线 导线 about -- the gold . 
these 导线 conduction 安培 current when they all machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do , because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so below minus 271摄氏度 planet in the temperature of the space between the case of these 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a 接点 install technology is a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to a little bit more of the transmission it by resistance 安培 current suddenly 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet material weighs about a mile and a ruler . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
they unloaded , put down to the work done . 
we gave them joy , it &apos;s good . 
now just waiting for them back to the ground . 
in about three to refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data , and then continue our mission to find out of the most basic of the universe . 
now obviously , so one of these accidents back about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still in the pursuit of projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
thank you .

I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , but nonetheless , a specific event recently in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where people are , I think this is the result is that life , and no matter where people are , I think this is my life . 
so , really , is completely , saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very anxious , came to me and said , “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you are not beyond that book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never succeed ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of going to continue to collapse on you ? 
you end up in the fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , I was always get questioning , etc . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
actually , except that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t think that actually , except that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? 
no one said , &quot; John , chemical “ work ? I met a bottleneck ” ? 
could never ask this happened . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineer this group , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and global , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses 英年早逝 case for the last century just look at the early creative genius , great areas are often the case is 英年早逝 gently died . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent . 
Noam 曼梅 , died in the last time I was saying : every book “ 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
my work for you , this is how the radical . 
today I want to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? I &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? 
you think this is not a problem ? even further away at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of the outside in 
this view , and not only 可憎 terrible , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this view , and not only 可憎 terrible , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century 可憎 , and not only that , I don &apos;t want this terrible ideas have been to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses continue to be alive . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , especially in my career stage right now , especially in my career . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of career 
and frankly , we have to look at that time , I said , quote , friends , and the heart , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
is this idea , to make people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back , is this idea , to make people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deep in my view , to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from extreme anxiety writing itself , and I work for extreme anxiety received . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go back to the problem . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable . 
the people who come to call this kind of creative 精灵 ” stewards for “ for it . 
and people often think Socrates , a stewards for that is from a distance to give him to think that general wisdom was that people have a -- Socrates stewards for wisdom , from a distance to give him . 
Ancient Rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people have similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is amazing , this is what I &apos;m looking for that is to make this safe distance from people who work on protecting the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by this ancient artists , and get protection of the ancient artist narcissistic by this idea , and get protection of narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of ” “ genius of the project . 
if you work is terrible , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is the Westerners in the last for a long time about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes , the sun swallow this for vulnerable individual , is too big . 
this is a completely distorted the cognitive self , and for people to expand the achievement was completely distorted . this one &apos;s perception , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years , I think of artists get this pressure , which is in the last 500 years of artists beating . 
if this is really , at least , I think this is so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the ancient past , with reference for them to understand human creativity ? maybe we should go back to the ancient past , with reference for them to understand human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 ideas of the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
well , maybe I can convince you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you had this experience will know the creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s beyond common 
like , on a breath of emptying down at her .

she could feel it , because this is the power to 撼动 her feet .

in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said she had some are almost 错过 poem . 
and then she would take out the other hand , grab that poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the last word go by , after all , the word . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s incredible , the creative process , and I , of course , it &apos;s not me ! -- all of the creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I work so much more like a way . 
but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get the idea of an accident , but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get an accident .

in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of all are cheering you on your way : would you “ 嘞 , Alabama , kept 嘞 , Alabama , really great , great , that &apos;s incredible ” miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 for artists to wake up , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn wake up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning that is , he &apos;s no miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old mortals and , maybe he couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe we will not dance to people in his all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should since ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is my self in one of the most painful cognitive 
this is a very tricky issues , which is my self in one of the most painful cognitive , this is a very tricky issues , which is my self in one of the most painful cognitive 
but maybe , we have been so painful , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed .

and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you 嘞 ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate trend that scientists are worth more than the predictions about , and for that he ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the equivalent of the area of South America by 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but these are not exactly this question of , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the beating heart of the climate system . 
in the winter and summer actually hyperextending the heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is a permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter , and this is a form of the Year in summer , ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing permanent “ ” form , I &apos;m talking about five or more of ice , you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and by the letter was freezing . 干冰 defrost , methane , carbon clean from microbes . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in Lake already you can see the went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a year melting of the river . 
but 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
here is a dramatic rise in the traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report to reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest himalayas , in ice in the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world to get water from its molten half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice , drinking water . 
in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry dramatically increase the numbers . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of four times more 七十五年 early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the past five years , we &apos;re adding CO2 to the ocean every 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
watch the east to west , from the Pacific region in India on the continent time dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
the oil is very important , the most urgent coal . 
the United States is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what some of the has and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what reminded me . 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee dig out of coal muck billions of dollars . 
you may have seen in the news . 
here , the second largest put the water . 
before Christmas , in this happen . 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see he productive , more productive economy , and he also help us . 
and the coal cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of virginia west , where the coal . 
the most is the head of the coal mining massey 
so , climate protection alliance and Al Gore is one of the current and work on two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s the smell of clean . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s go to look like the art of clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but this is the sound of clean coal technology . 
although burn coal , global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the national security and economic challenge . 
in the U.S. national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis . 
all these crisis strings together is based on carbon , like the product of oil on the dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
repower america clean electricity with 100 percent of the time in 10 years . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
the final 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet , and this is for us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
in the future . here &apos;s the wind , solar energy , new network . 
the investment to create a new kind of work . 
has repower america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about as you play in the building blocks . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . it is to understand and 空间结构 objects . 
to understand the object 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
the questions that are sitting in my mind , so we decided to find answers , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable can move each other , the perception of each other , and 每块 siftable monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information of the tools . 
this tool , more independent , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception of any subtle , so we can use this kind of interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
this is like siftable reflection configuration , if I put it side to it , so that &apos;s in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they are a resounding 挨 a good , interesting phenomenon that &apos;s going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , they &apos;ll also aware , that would have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other and perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that color down to one another , you pour it from a siftable siftable . 
we look at this , there are three sets of patterns to paint barrel siftables , we can put these bucket pour the color of the middle of the color , which together . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic -- is that language , and through these functions -- we want to learn to become more quickly see , on-the-spot results . 
this is also , I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
these words siftables can play a game -- and boggle scrabble remix of games . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable with dollars , when you put together siftables letters of the word , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of the words , right , you can also trying to build new in other words , the letters . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , some of the screen is in the Media Lab children are involved in the test siftables experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word games ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just wanted to siftables stack together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new graphics to add elements , what he did was put on the table , towards the siftables pick up some graphics , you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he added up to the Sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now he put it in the Galapagos . 
in orange . 
do good ! 
in the siftables graphics can bring forth a new elements to this new elements add up to him -- 吠 dog . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plan , his story . 
sitting in a cat off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function , playing music is even more recently , we developed this siftables function in sound domain , can make a sound like 超载 note , the sound of drums and Bess . 
every tiles , had to regulate 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable hit you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles tiles . 
there is something like a sound filter , which 响器 siftable of tiles . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control the overall rhythm and volume of the modules to edit siftable tiles siftable to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put into two editors 超载 note , plus some tiles 超载 . 
now to join 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to put sound filter modules , Drums tiles that can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to need to accelerate the pace of tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to put sound filter , Bessel tiles filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can also . 
so we don &apos;t need to play , but even in advance , all based , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles tiles on the left , to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium computer-human interaction with the better the brain works . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you in the idea is that we developed a new generation of cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology to bring the world , it &apos;s going to change this revolution in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
