rapture through photos and stories , for National Geographic by Wade Davis explorers of the world to celebrate culture as the Native Americans , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we all was born in the world and 生儿育女 母腹 
we have to go through the adult would sculpted by millennia . 
we have the brutal 生离死别 so we &apos;re going to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 in the life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find the culture of songs rhythm and pace dance with unique . 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you send will now thinking that will let you see the future . 
the world 五彩缤纷 犹如 by a culture of culture and live a life of the Earth is covered the whole network of the Earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the web 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity is very strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
the biosphere as the erosion of race and the end of the same with the destruction of it and faster . 
and one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet have had some misgivings : six different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
human language is a flash of light . 
and it &apos;s actually a unique culture in this 承 carriers of the world . 
each one is a language that an ecosystem spirit and a long time and precipitation . 
we know the Earth is six : 00 language that and we all in the same number of language , there is no longer have to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 in other words , effective rules act , unless they &apos;re going to be completely gone . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to be the last 本族语 said there was no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of the children of how this would be lonely and scary . 
another spooky on Earth is about every two weeks . it &apos;s going to be a 仙逝 with an ancient is the language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race to loop loop race , you have to understand , and the overall . you are to lose civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot “ said I live in front of the different ” way , I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example this child 亚玛逊 live in the northwest part of the Arabic is that they &apos;re called 蚺 because they believe in a race of the time that they were born in 米尔克 coming from the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t tell the difference between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 in their so with the forest canopy and no difference . 
they say the language of a weird and follow the rules , a unique 通婚 通婚 异族 linguistics . it &apos;s called a to the people with a different language married . 
this is based on through the history of mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see 操练 people have a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador race to the most amazing 华拉尼 is one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
1957 missionaries five years to try to these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they from eight to leave the air 十张 pictures of himself , and we think this is kind of , but they didn &apos;t think about these people live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use 戮 with this missionary five died . 
more of that is not only 戮 华拉尼 external die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is by their own 戮 people die . 
we found only to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 两例 natural death 刨根问底 we finally they said , the truth , and the more old people go to the wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have a forest 惊诧 revealed . 
they can smell unsporting characters , a 40 开外 animals smell urine and know that &apos;s what the animal urine . 
in order to understand it . I have to figure out the magic and voodoo religious teaching is going to teach isn &apos;t a voodoo the magic of the dark . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the most important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about it is living with a connection between them . 
in living soul . 
the dance 大水 to tap the rhythm can replace &apos;s soul of the soul of the living in the short 侍僧成 moment for the flash of light . 
so voodoo who like to say you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
in groups all of my life in the north of Columbia in the mountains of 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
and this is the ancient civilization tyranny they were once conquered and in the Caribbean coast in plain Columbia since they go back to the isolated mountains of a plain . 
in this continent globe in bloody ethnic and Spain has never been to the people . 
and to today , they will monk 续 along with the institutions , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain is these values and the universe -- and we can call it the relationship between the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it beautiful . 
they call for their lies for over , we say we are in the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
it &apos;s not going to indigenous 多愁善感 思乡 would not suffer the torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain of God or 矿石 is a bunch of this , it doesn &apos;t matter . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship between people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to the forest was cut down . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this is a picture of me last year in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent spirit and plant it often 萨满教 徒 die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent dopamine color of the components of it with the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe of people have from serotonin , plants extract sucking nose and with this thing . 
if you take a powder in these hallucinations , these wacky , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s in front of you are not distorted 荡然无存 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be the organ for the kind of a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
these oral to color dopamine matter and have to change oral 氧化酶 dopamine , one of the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in 藤本植物 β 啉 咔 -- there was going to be able to control 氧化酶 dopamine agonists color and play the potency of everyone must ask yourself , so you 
when we do all kinds of experiments are wrong to measure it . 
but if you ask Indians will say they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people die in the cane is all in the deep jungle , they found that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , &quot; I want you to have some plants . 
you &apos;re not necessarily plants have to say I don &apos;t know . 
I tell you that if they said this in the months of circle around each one of the growing plants , the use of different singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , and some of our compassion with indigenous people think they 离群索居 enrich lives on the world , but as we develop these people in the back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with interest is still Indians and the horse and carriage to sit still life &apos;s in the United States . 
the threat of race or change is not intact technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we look at in Tibet recently where I do a lot of research , where you can see some of the authoritarian political . 
and by the genocide in the same race , culture , but denounce extinction , which is the destruction of the people living crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of the praise by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with that . 
and this young man 班禅 喇嘛 皈依 father . 
the Chinese immediately after he was killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together to Nepal . 
his mother 富农 because family is locked up right here , and then when you sit down . 
there are only two years old , and he and his mother and quietly in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
just because of his sister behavior , and by the 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of 臂章 and being a nation of 劳教 to seven years . 
the pain of Tibet elusive redemption through the human spirit need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice is we want to live in a single world still need to a 五彩缤纷 diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve drained 60 . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
新石器 into an agricultural revolution of human time , we would like to these seeds 腊 萨满 &apos;s poetry is the rabbi . we &apos;ve created for all of this just 社会分工 level 10 : 00 years ago . 
the modern industrial society will only last 三百年 history . 
in my view of history and the short enough to have the ability for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
when we different cultures in the world to ask about the meaning in life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : the species that there &apos;s a completely fully realize we have to make sure that all race , and all 昌盛 to live a life of prosperity . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern part of the mountain 巴芬岛 I was with some of the Inuit , to catch the narwhals 奥拉雅 people told me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government doesn &apos;t do the Inuit , to build our national sovereignty away , and we &apos;re going to settlement . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
he worried about his family and all of the safety of weapons and took tools . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the one advantage thick . 
they sled of the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear of the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside in his skin seal 长裤 stool put his hands to when shit faster stiffen , he put it into the shape of the blades 
and in this shit on the edge of the spitting 口水 blades , and then it became very frozen solid , and then he put knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
off the skin 挽具 a dog made out of your chest , and he made a dog sleds dogs to the other one was that don &apos;t get the shit in on the knife . 
this is really 空手 make life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 becomes real life . 
April 1999 to Canada than the area of the size of Texas and California 之和 larger land returned back to the Inuit , 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions , New Le 
this is a control of their independence , where all the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country , can make a difference to repair it with the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think that used to go to the rural areas in the world , some of you who don &apos;t actually remote . 
because there is a species as the planet . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people think about it , but we can get to the world , so we can change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on a website , the amount of three to five million 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
the Y arcas blaise aguera photosynth demo of this stunning , the software that could change the way we watch . using digital images from the picture of pick out a static photosynth , create a kind of stunning vision , and we can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
we see here is the 千兆 and gigabits lots and lots and lots of bytes . level of our digital photographs , and they can continue to the full can zoom in , by the way through , and they can rearrange them . 
no matter how many have all the data images , how much of the images and how much seadragon , have the ability to deal with this . 
most of the show this picture was taken by digital camera , but this is a picture of it , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress scan the picture , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between limits , because the only factor performance system : just what you like the use of the screen 素数 seadragon . and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;m going to show you that this is really not text and images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
now , that &apos;s a more , this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture did starts . 
and the newspaper or paper version itself is the ratio of images , in reading , people will get better experience , reading to enjoy the joy of reading . 
we do here in a small change in The Guardian issues that to the corner . 
we make them up a high-resolution picture advertising than this -- you just see the normal high resolution of advertising , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see that the car , you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way to avoid the actual use of the screen . 
we hope that this technology can reduce the cause of unnecessary window and thrown like garbage information . 
obviously , with this technology , the digital maps is so obvious , and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made this field of ourselves . 
these were just at NASA geospatial basis . 
and that &apos;s overlaid to deal with the road map of the United States . 
now , let &apos;s look at this , down the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it &apos;s actually merging two different : the technology . 
one is seadragon , from the other , and at the University of Washington noah graduate snavely computer vision of what the research . this research , get seitz Steve Washington University . 
and Microsoft szeliski Rick Institute of help . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
in this project on the Internet has already applied seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see here , we can easily picture of the way to do , is able to look at pictures to do more nuanced and have at the resolution to experience . 
these images , but in the space is actually a very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of this than to place . 
because the website , we made a lot of respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would come and work for Microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see that these images of many different from the camera phone camera , from a single professional to the other . so a lot of different picture of the mass of all , in this together in the environment . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , a lot of pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here -- should have a sequence of images , in here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
so the important point here is that ? well , we can use the Internet community . we can learn from each person is going to get to the memory of a different environment , collect together to build models . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all of them . 
this is a model , is the whole planet . 
this is like Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , you will be in the tag . 
thank you very much . 
if I understanding you right now in the future is going to be a few years from around the world will 接合 pictures together ? 
the software . this is what &apos;s significant to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this process is completely 接合 images based on the content . 
the more exciting is that contains images of semantic text information . 
for example , you go on a picture type , on the page , will have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , all these pictures and images of you , that would be like ? 
at that time , so these semantic information of links , and within each other &apos;s a huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s incredible ! you congratulate . 
thank you very much . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
and I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve already heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to from a of faith . 
what kind of creed ? 
it was the whole industrial 笃信 Western society , not by a credo . 
this is faith say this : if we want to get people the benefits of the way , is to maximize to individual liberty . 
and the reason for that is free , and that is good , has value , the need for people . 
other people , once we have free , everybody can 做主 ourselves with all the way , I don &apos;t get benefits for people to 做主 . 
the freedom to be a way that &apos;s the selectivity increase . 
people more choice is freedom , freedom , the more and more , the more that welfare . 
I think , so that when you add it like this idea that into the water that we are firmly rooted in that people didn &apos;t want to be up to that question . 
the same ideas and deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
and I &apos;m going to show you some examples of contemporary look at the progress of social development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
you see , this is what it looks like a supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store to a three-dimensional stereo system -- and it includes a CD , blah , blah , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system is a lot more . 
with this store components 650万种 close out you can have 3D combination of all the sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s a pile of choice . 
a industry , let &apos;s talk about communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and Maya , you have to go , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
generally , is that we &apos;re not going to die at the phone . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
and now there &apos;s an almost inexhaustible supply of the species , especially . that cell phone . 
these are the future of the cell phone . 
and I love most in the middle -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , a French and cut hair forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store , seen with no , don &apos;t have to worry about how you &apos;re going to see . 
this is the result of people , I went to the store and said , you have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
the answer is no ” “ . 
now you probably don &apos;t have to buy a not so many things stem cell phones . 
the same in life , in some other than a shopping thing that we choose the Big Bang , this is the same . 
health care in the United States , right now -- is that you don &apos;t go to the doctor , who do so , how do you tell the time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use nail treatment , and you can use it 乙 . 
and so forth , there &apos;s very nail solution and risk . 
and so forth and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , how do I do ” ? 
they say it , and I have these nail 乙 risk , and I have the risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” ? 
they said , but I don &apos;t you “ ” . 
now the prescription for advertising , all of the drugs that the ordinary people with you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s just say , we can &apos;t just counter to buy . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call the doctor , on a prescription drugs on them . 
now we like the gender of the identity of the things that are kind of choice . it &apos;s like trying to convince you of this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we could get back to the gender of the shape itself . 
this is every morning you woke up to you today , you have to get to what people want to do a men and women are the decision . 
in the marriage of family , everyone in the past age is to take for granted that is almost got married , and then there &apos;s 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I was married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart and good students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they than the students , stupid . it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t worked so . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , I always ask yourself : what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to kids , and I knew business ? 
this is the 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether or not they do I do homework , whether in my class and they take what grades . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s important question . 
now working , like Carl said earlier , we really is a blessing , we can make progress in the day , any time in any one corner of the Earth -- this is , of course , a basket 夫 , except a hotel . 
but in a restaurant , and this really WiFi can have a place , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
we say , the incredible work that we have freedom of choice is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , for their work now is to break moved . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 when the mobile phone , and another 裤兜 BlackBerry with the blackberry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even if they &apos;re closed , we are looking at the same rivals for the kids and ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick up the phone ? 
or you don &apos;t go back to this email ? should I wrote this 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself , you don &apos;t think the answer is that this child to the experience of the game is severely compromised . it is . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big stuff , and the way to live life is , in terms of choice . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there is nothing , but don &apos;t need are choices . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what this is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know the benefits of it . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these choices for people , there are two and a negative impact on the two . 
first of all , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we have -- it &apos;s not , but inside , is we numb . 
it a lot of people have found a very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan for his retirement income in terms of investment . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest in the vanguard vanguard . record is a huge helps fund companies have about a million people , and two , 000多个 office . 
and she found is that when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of species increases every 10 to reduce the number of two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 people than you five , 10 percent down to fund . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to choose to choose to think that it was even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
a major tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
not to this plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide are obsessed with this . 
so many possibilities , choice is the result of paralysis . 
and it allows us to the world look like this and this slide . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose a wrong fund , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a few reasons . 
the more choices , the more likely to inexplicably something to feel regret . this is one of them , is not always satisfaction of choice . 
and second , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a enough , we see is a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when there &apos;s a lot of people to think about , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you gave up the choice of the ways , and it makes you like to think that you see the 美中不足 . 
so an example of that . and if you don &apos;t , New York , I &apos;m going to a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 the Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have it . 
and it &apos;s more than that , OK ? in this to “ huh , really bad , ” “ ” , in August is now . 
“ Manhattan of your neighbors are not ” . 
I &apos;m going to be “ to stop , you can go back to my door ” . 
two weeks , and he was suffering from an idea that every day , 念叨 lost in the good of the parking . 
“ ” cost to get us to have good enough to make the decision , even if it &apos;s actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these choices , the more of it , these things are the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it &apos;s also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s about to do step . 
one of them , but it is , when you choose to do something , and you just have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing that tend to have a lot of you to decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I have to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last jeans , that &apos;s a pattern , you don &apos;t buy pants , come back , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in the long enough time to do that , after several times , get 凑合 pants . 
so , in the years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want a jeans , this is the size of the I ” . 
and the : are you going to say , the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
and to the front of his buttons . the lockset is 石磨 ? is it , the wash ? 
to quickly that grinds them ? 
and the back , and it &apos;s the ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw , almost off . and I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to that is used to be the pattern of ” . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a place I walked out of the most 合身 pants store . 
I don &apos;t really have to do it . I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? why is it that I wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , the reason is because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a jeans , what are good to be a good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least in the economy is a perfect . 
and I really good , but it isn &apos;t perfect . 
I have , so I had to go and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expected of me , this becomes disappointing . 
in the lives of people together , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond that many people didn &apos;t give good . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
the market do not know the truth . because if they know people there , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all the bad things all over the last better than now . 
the reason is , when one of the things that are not good for people to experience that might have some surprises . 
now , those of us in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
you don &apos;t know what , what will be , because I than you would expect of God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so it , I think , let &apos;s take a little bit of time , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a very good wife . 
the thing that I didn &apos;t 凑合 , what I &apos;m trying to do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are in store for you in hundreds of jeans , you buy a happy , don &apos;t think back , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
out there on the hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t have any excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if you get to decide that it is they &apos;re good to be disappointed . , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and the clinical explosive growth is depressed . 
and finally , the net effect is the objective , even though we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
and this choice about the well-being of principles , we think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s completely wrong . that &apos;s not right . 
of course , there &apos;s no choice but to choose , choose predictions are that you can &apos;t more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we choose ‘ far beyond what we need ’ rich , and the key . 
I said . now let &apos;s talk about a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many of the matter is , a rich . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world , where we &apos;ve heard about a few of at least , there &apos;s no problem , too much . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is rich modern Western societies of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday indignant , said , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seat 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated , it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us from not as before . 
this is what economists call 帕累 and improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of us , like the plague of choice . 
the end of the , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position of intelligence “ said , &quot; Huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything is impossible ” . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting is , read this . 
but the more , I think that it was obvious that the more fish must know something about it . 
if you want to be honest , because everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you &apos;re a is , is the paralyzed . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and in this fish -- for this fish , it &apos;s possible for us , almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish and that means is , maybe to put suffering , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the meaning of the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we do in the digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to the digital code to a new design of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to come up with some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists and try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now almost 20 years , we &apos;ve used it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome from biology , it &apos;s kind of September the analysis of the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can life , or whether we went from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome to make it can replicate in the lab , we &apos;re trying to understand . and if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from 500组 一百组 out of genes that we have in front of these . 
so , we can continue to think that the only way is to study these synthetic chromosome so we can change its part of the most fundamental to continue to ask the question . 
and so we started to walk along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life in the exponential rate and speed . 
the ability to write our genetic code to progress very slowly , but also the increase in our recent . what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it through the stages . and when we do for the first trial ago , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline of the process , the more than that , the more it wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first Phi X 174 , from the phage , and the digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
the other stages of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill the E. coli 兰氏 different and negative fungus . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that these numbers to accurate information . 
in 1995 , when we first to this group of subjects , gene sequencing is every 10,000 to a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to , on average , 30 is wrong . if we use the sequence , set of genes that would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design 50 character and the other than the character of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
we have one of the design of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these 三联 of the body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a map . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the first , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we didn &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and the design that we can use the bias enzyme which cuts . some are enzymes to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from 70 length of time to put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time and time getting out , and at a long time . 
each of us in the stage , so that we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable . you &apos;re going to see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve the level of the automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 of . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s very difficult to continue coil . in the long longer . in trying to make the modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology , to repair the DNA , put it into a piece . 
here &apos;s an example of a tolerance called microbes 球菌 radiation to be able to withstand 三百万度 amount of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images of it , in all the chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , the before . 
we can have this , there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes to be completely out of water . they can in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and life there , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples like this . 
here we have a group of this molecule . these microscopic images through the process , which is what the yeast , and the way we design and put it into the yeast . they will automatically , essentially . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
so this is a big molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
these are 六秒 about it . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than the genetic code 580000 character . it &apos;s by humans setting the structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t 10-point font distance to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we get to a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do a very simple more complicated . 
we like to deal with that this is a relatively simple , you can take out into the nucleus , and then another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought that just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we found that all the species and the second one took the chromosome from or other places in the third side of the chromosomes , within seconds the thousands and thousands of new feature to its own . 
what people were held in the process of evolution &apos;s every time a genetic change ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limits , is to be able to enzyme , from digesting the DNA . 
the chromosome out of cells and not without this enzyme , and when we go in and have a chromosome . 
and that &apos;s it , and recognize the other , it &apos;s the matter to them , and then finally , we have to have a new DNA . 
we put it into a gene causing the blue . 
in a very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all gone , and completely into a new species , we put on the cell ” “ new software . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it actually is that we will implant . 
this may seem like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do that ? 
I think we need some of the reason for this is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own , and I was born in 1946 . 
now in the world would be the three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , in four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , very , very difficult to all the fuel . 
which 捉襟见肘 that &apos;s nine billion people . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature programs can replace or any of it , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , this is the material of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
now we have found from around the world in a database of 两千万组 about genes , and I like to see them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have that kind of technology , because we can make these “ call the mixing ” group of very synthetic . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can choose to live in , the fuel or chemical production , the production and so on . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that we actually sit in the computer work really use software to design the design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on 第四代 “ ” fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . fuel into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
and the sun is one of the carbon dioxide -- . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane into the molecules of its energy source . 
we could look at the two things to get their , very convenient , they can be introduced into , with fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can increase the life for ? &quot; &quot; what is the understanding of basic questions . 
we have with the whole oil industry , the little good . so if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there might be a ? the energy . 
and we are using tools made out of the same instant vaccine . 
you can all of this flu , we always have to slow down in the year in the absence of time and money , when the vaccine useful . 
I think this can be a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last thing is that and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re better from a human life on the far more and more . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough time , maybe you can do it . thank you very much . 
in this short , the estimated 09年 TED talk , Brian Cox shares some which super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
in the last year at TED , I talk about the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to update it is the work in the machine . 
and here it is , if you don &apos;t last year , to the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in the universe , reinventing the billionth of a second per second state and began to make a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we use these little changes to probe the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas of the process of building magnificent scale that can be huge . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas of the photos . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first picture of particles clusters of all the way , as we all around the LHC along with the LHC plan , in part of a lot of particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know this is a 满堂喝彩 -- this is when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work on this with the culture of it as a research . 
but about a week later , we machines out of a little bit about the 导线 with these shiny -- these 导线 . 
these 导线 conduction 安培 current when they all . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ those wires , not too little ” . 
they can do because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so below minus 271摄氏度 planet in the space between the temperature in the case that these 导线 can transmission of electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 of 电磁铁 接点 on a technology for a mistake . 
so a little 导线 temperature rise to the transmission it a little bit more , and their resistance by 安培 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet material they move it weighs about a mile rule . 
we have about 50 magnet impaired . 
they have to work , unloaded has done . 
we gave them joy . it &apos;s good . 
now , they &apos;re back to the ground . 
in about three of the refer to be the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data , and we continue to figure out the mission of the most basic units . 
now obviously , so one of these accidents to a cutting-edge science and engineering , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s still too difficult task projects we pursuit of the fact is , itself in the value of the LHC . 
thank you . 
Elizabeth Gilbert . 呵护 talk about creativity and create reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change . 
but recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event recently , but in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
now , it turns out to people , no matter where I think this is my life as a result , no matter what I now where people are , I think that &apos;s life . 
so , really , completely , saved , 完了 play . 
they have to worry about it and said to me , “ . don &apos;t you ? don &apos;t be afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of going to continue to collapse on you ? 
you end up in the fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , and I was always get questioning , and so on and so forth . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
well beyond that , I was afraid of a lot of people don &apos;t think that this actually , I was afraid of a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but fear to say , writing , I was wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but fear to say , writing , I was wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is a cerebral idea ? 
people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in your own destiny logical ? it work ? 
nobody “ said , &quot; John , chemical work with a bottleneck ” ? how ? 
could never ask this happened . 
and of course , this chemical engineers 平心而论 , not just in the last few centuries of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and global not in the last few centuries of addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and around the world . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 early last century just look at different areas , with great geniuses 英年早逝 is often the case before died . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent . 
and the 曼梅 , died in the last time ago “ said , in every one of my book 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , this is how the radical . 
today I want to ask all of you is : you are not exceptions to that ? I &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you are not exceptions to that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of the outside in 
this is not only 可憎 , terrible , and I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 , terrible , and I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century 可憎 not only that , and scary , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses continue to be alive . 
and I myself , believed that I would certainly in the dark , due to myself , and I believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage now in my career , especially now in my career . 
you see , I was a young man , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was a young man , I was 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and frankly , are we all talk about that long , and I say , is a friend , and the heart , potentially , is the largest , I &apos;ve been successful . 
Oh my God , what is this idea . 
is this idea , on the road to a 大清早 drank -- not the wine , way back to this idea is , on the road to a 大清早 drank -- not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deeper in my view , to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protection . 
in some way , I have to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from anxiety writing itself , and I work for the anxiety received . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we sent back to end up . 
in the ancient Greek and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred 精灵 of distant and unknowable to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called this in common with 精灵 of creativity for “ ” stewards for 
and people often think Socrates stewards for this is from a distance , and gives him that general wisdom was that people have Socrates stewards for a wisdom gives him from a distance . 
the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 “ called ” genius , the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 “ called ” genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent , wonderful this view of Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is a view , that &apos;s what I &apos;m looking for that is to make this safe distance from people who work on protecting the 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand how it , right ? 
artist ancient by this idea . and , of the ancient artist narcissistic . and by this idea of narcissistic , and avoid . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of “ ” genius of the project . 
if you work a terrible , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is a Western in the last for a long time to think about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes , which is the sun swallow one-nth of vulnerability , is too big . 
it completely down to one &apos;s perception , and to make an individual . completely down to this one &apos;s perception , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artist is I think this pressure , get in the last 500 years of artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least I think that this is the question is : we do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : we do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 ideas of the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
well , maybe I can &apos;t convinced you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , trying to create a for any of you who believe in you had this experience will know the creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
like on a breath of emptying down her face . 
she can feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she can feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing , and she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
on the other , and this is called me the most amazing part : on the other , and this is called me the most amazing part : sometimes she said she are almost 错过 poem . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail to get it back on the other hand , poetry to 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
when this poem , will intact , which is just in the order of upside down , from the last word go by , after all , the word . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my work is more like a so . 
but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get the idea of an accident , but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get the idea of an accident . 
in a lot of people might have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to , and I don &apos;t know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to , and I don &apos;t know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on here ? 
in how we &apos;re going to look at it , not rational ? we have lost in how to think about it , don &apos;t have lost rational ?

occasionally , though , to see , but actually going to happen one dancers will 出世 transcendent , and beyond 
you know that I should say that because you &apos;ve all seen , in a moment of that . 
time to stop a dancer , it seems to stop across time as a dancer , through what he did the before and 1000场 performance isn &apos;t anything different , but all amazingly , it all together . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , his life , from the bottom of light from the inside . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , light from the inside of his life , he was light from the bottom of the sacred shine . 
clearly , people know what it is , they can call it the name was clearly , people know what it is , they can name it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of all are cheering you on your way to “ : you know , Alabama 嘞 嘞 Alabama , you know , really , really great , great , that &apos;s incredible ” miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , of the most intractable is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 artists to wake up around , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn awake at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning that is , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to go for the old people , and maybe he couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe we will not dance , when he was all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should have since ? 
this is a very smart questions , and it &apos;s in my perception of one of the most painful . 
this is a very smart questions , and it &apos;s in my perception of one of the most painful , this is a very smart questions , and it &apos;s in my perception of one of the most painful . 
but maybe we don &apos;t have that , so if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought of that , starting from you completely art . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
don &apos;t fear , “ . don &apos;t you just have to do that part of the ” . 
don &apos;t fear , “ . don &apos;t you just have to do that part of the ” . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : what if you are , it &apos;s dancer dance . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : what if you are , it &apos;s dancer dance . 
so , if you don &apos;t have to dance , hold your jobs , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
so , if you don &apos;t have to dance , hold your jobs , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you know , 嘞 ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists think is worth more than the predictions about that , and he “ for ” clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of South America by 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but it &apos;s not a question of this completely because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
it , the polar ice cap -- just like the heart of the climate system . 
in the summer , and actually hyperextending heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter and this is a form of the Year in the summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing ” “ context , I &apos;m talking about five or more form of ice you see , it &apos;s like to blood 各部 a body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a huge amount of carbon by was freezing . defrost 干冰 and clean microbes , methane , carbon . 
now , if the top of the greenhouse gas emissions , is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of the global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter 结队 professor light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of the heat Greenland . 
this is one of the melting of every year . 
but 往年 than it is . 
this is the southwest Greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand how the land of melting ice to sea level rise here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
here &apos;s the traffic is rising . 
the Earth , the other side of the ice of the planet . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and a few below sea level is accelerating the melting . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest himalayas in ice , in the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from being in the water get half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice , drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent every year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
the world is causing fire and dry big number . 
and the number of the world in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of four times more 七十五年 early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
and if you look at the history , you can see what happened . 
in the last five years we increase the ocean every day 七千万吨 CO2 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
watch the next to the west , from the Pacific region in India , on the continent and dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
oil , coal , the most urgent is very important . 
the world &apos;s largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a used to use more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
this is what has some new and some of the green alternative . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
coal and carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 appeal to clean coal , which is a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of what . 
before Christmas , my home in Tennessee out of coal muck billions of dollars . 
you can see on the news . 
here , there is the second largest put the water . 
this is what happens before Christmas of 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see the more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
Mr. cool coal in every single day more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s virginia west , where a lot of coal . 
the head of the top is the coal mining massey 
so Al Gore and climate protection of people work is one of the current and launched two projects . 
this is one of the part of one of them . 
coalergy in very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s the smell of clean . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at the art as clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and burn coal with global warming is one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now a clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the national security and economic challenge . 
in the U.S. national security , the economic crisis , the climate crisis . 
these are the strings together is based on oil on the product of carbon , such as the dirty import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve these problems . 
repower america 100 percent in the last 10 years of clean electricity . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america know more . 
the final 
this is about repower america . 
the old oil and dirty murder in our planet is that we rely on the right to reduce the fastest way . 
the future . here &apos;s the wind , solar energy , a new network . 
the investment to create a new kind of work . 
repower has america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables -- you get a toy . 
first of all , I want you to think about as you play in the building blocks . 
when you idea how to build with Legos and to the hands-on , you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is the object for 空间结构 and understand . 
to understand the object 空间结构 very helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
so the question I would keep in mind , so we decided to find the answer , it &apos;s so siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable can move each other , perception of each other , monitor and 每块 siftable and radio device . 
the most important siftable 每块 is , it &apos;s the same building blocks , like , you can . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information of the tools . 
this individual more tools , more sensitive to each other , with any sense , the perception , so we can use this to try to some interesting new tools . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
this siftable reflection there , if I put it side to it , so that it &apos;s in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put a 挨 out a really interesting phenomenon , OK , it &apos;s going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of them , be aware of it , it would be a little bit chaos . 
they can move each other and perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by -- we can use some siftables and interact with gestures , like a liquid that put down from a color siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s in three siftables barrels of oil paint patterns , we can put these barrel into color in the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning of language , and we can use to learn arithmetic , etc . -- is , we want to use these functions on-the-spot learning to become more quickly , and see . 
and that &apos;s what I came to siftables show here -- the reason that I used a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble boggle and remix of games . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable with dollars , and when you put together the letters siftables of words , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , on the screen some kids are in the Media Lab siftables in the test of experience , I &apos;m going to take the kids experience . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them together , this is a “ ” words , they know how to do . 
now on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the bottom right corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just wanted to siftables of together . 
in his mind , is just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables people learn language . 
this is the child Felix . 
he could use some new graphics to add elements , what he did was to the table siftables towards to pick up some graphics , you can put these new to add elements on it . 
look at the sun , and he put up . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David he put it in . 
in orange . 
do good . 
shake graphics siftables put in a new can add elements to this new elements add up to him -- 吠 dogs . 
he wrote in the story of his animation . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plan , his story . 
sitting in the fly away . 
and I &apos;m going to show you one last to show this to function , playing music is even more recently , we &apos;ve developed siftables , in this capability of the sound domain , can make a sound like 超载 note , and the sound of drums and . 
every tiles , had to regulate 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable the sound of the modules to sound editors siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a sound filter , which 响器 siftable the tiles . 
this kind of put tiles tiles sound can adjust to sound . 
and then , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume edited close to the tiles siftable tiles siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
the first started 超载 into the two tiles , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums , so that it can adjust tiles . 
I &apos;m going to accelerate the pace of tiles rhythm to just close to edit module . 
now turn to filter the tiles . the filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , and we can . 
so we don &apos;t need to play in , but even in advance , all based , but long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with tiles , play the entire volume edited tiles on the left , close to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium for computer-human interaction with the better the brain works . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we &apos;re in the lab . 
I want to talk to you in the idea is that we developed a new generation of combining cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and technology , it &apos;s going to bring to the world of this change in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
together , and I look forward to .
