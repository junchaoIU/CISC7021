images and stories through rapture for National Geographic , by Wade Davis explorers of the world to celebrate culture Aboriginal these cultural diversity , of course , are incredibly fast from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
of course we all follow the same sort of flexible rule . 
we are born in the world and 母腹 生儿育女 
we have to go through the adult would showered . 
have we so 生离死别 cruel to sing and dance with the life 排遣 苦楚 we create art . 
but you &apos;ll see that each of the song rhythm and pace , dance has unique signature . 
all these groups of a different show us how to survive and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you text now going to be thinking that you see the future . 
the world by a 犹如 五彩缤纷 culture of culture and live a life of the Earth cover the whole network of the Earth for its 芸芸众生 has a very important part of what we call it the biosphere as important as the web ecology . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , as we are also have the ability to see all of a symbol of species . 
as the biosphere , all of the same race caps also facing the same speed , the destruction of it and bad luck . 
this was one of the most important is that sign language . 
we live in the original on this planet have 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s actually a unique culture all in this 承 carriers of the world . 
each is a language that kind of an ecosystem with a mental accumulate and precipitation long-term . 
we know the Earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language that we and all of these in the same amount of language , there is no longer to teach kids . 
these 传人 has no language , effective rules act , unless , which means they will be disappeared completely . 
when you imagine 有口难言 or , you say one last is that people can &apos;t be 本族语 lineage ancestors may not have the wisdom of predicting the future of the children of how this would be lonely and scary . 
another spooky on Earth is in fact , about every two weeks there will be a 仙逝 with the introduction of an ancient is the language . 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t speak their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race to let you loop in a circle , race , and let you personally feel in unraveling civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot “ said I live in a different way of saying I front ” “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 Landscape Bala dragged 蚺 multibillionaire called them in the race because they believe in a river 米尔克 from that mythology coming out of the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t distinguish between groups of people in the green and blue because they are 栖身 field of view , and so in the forest canopy 天穹 with no difference . 
they say , with a strange kind of language and follow some rules 通婚 通婚 异族 linguistics called that people have played with a different kind of language , married people . 
this is based on the mythology of history and legacy that you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see 操练 people have a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador ethnic 华拉尼 of the most amazing is that if one of the genocide in 1958 years , I &apos;ve ever had them with the kind of peace . 
five year 1957 , but they close to the missionaries that person made a fatal mistake . 
from their 十张 eight to leave the air , they have in the picture is that we think of that , but they didn &apos;t think about the water regulation by rainforests in life , these people have never seen pictures of two-dimensional 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through of trying to find these people what they found , but the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use 戮 with the missionaries five that died . 
not more horrifying 戮 华拉尼 is external to die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of the population is 戮 by themselves to death . 
for us to investigate 宗谱 一个八代 两例 found only in our natural death 刨根问底 they finally goes out to the truth is it being old of wood will 戮 will they when he died 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have the forest for 惊诧 surprising insights . 
they can predator of a 40 to smell urine animals 开外 tastes and know that &apos;s what the animal urine . 
in order to understand the way I have to figure out the magic and voodoo teach religion -- how teaching is not a voodoo the magic of darkness . 
this is the opposite of a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
this is very interesting . 
if I want you to list some important religions in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism some other religions . 
voodoo unique about it is with living connection between them . 
somehow living soul . 
the dance 大水 refresh can tap in rhythms -- just replace the soul of living in the spirit of that shining moment for 侍僧成 gods . 
so voodoo respectively worship church to say , you like to call God . 
we in the dance to become gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
in groups all of my life in the north of Columbia in the mountains 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization them at the Columbia the occupation and conquer the plain areas since they go back to the mountains of isolated a plain . 
in this bloody ethnic this across the globe by has never been to unite people Spain . 
and they today to would govern 续 along with monk , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
母腹 back as they have taught the values is these values and maintain the relationship between the universe and believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how it to protect you beautiful . 
they call myself for what we call lies is we say , over the world . 
this is very important to create the intuition . 
it will not indigenous 多愁善感 思乡 would not suffer the torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether this mountain of God is a just or shelter 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important , who was , like the relationship with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , by the local people on the ideas that I was cut down to the forest . 
if you look at it this way , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , and you &apos;ll understand very different way of life . 
this picture last year I was in August in the Northwest Amazon . 
this is 斯卡藤 阿亚胡 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent 徒 萨满教 plants anesthesia , the spirit to make it with water cane dead -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent agonists color of the components of it with the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
the tribes rice 亚诺马 from people with serotonin , plants extract sucking nose , and with this thing . 
if you use a nose swallows powder these hallucinations , these wacky , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
that &apos;s not in front of you in reality , it &apos;s twisting 荡然无存 
but that doesn &apos;t matter dopamine color because they oral organ body will be called a single change enzyme activity 氧化酶 dopamine . 
you still matter dopamine color these oral to a single change oral 氧化酶 dopamine , and the rest of chemicals . 
this is interesting β -- the existence of 藤本植物 咔 alone , you can actually 啉 氧化酶 dopamine agonists color play , and you &apos;re so clearly everyone must ask ourselves . 
we do all kinds of experiments that ordinary people would make mistakes repeatedly measure it . 
but if you ask Indians plant would say they would say . 
what does that mean ? 
the tribes 科凡 17 found people die on in their is all in the jungles , we seem to be different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say to you about my research has some plants . 
you &apos;re not to have some plants are not say I understand . 
you tell me that if they said they circle months in 17 that night , and each one of dealing with plants , the different singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. from Harvard , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , even though we compassion and some of them think with indigenous 离群索居 enrich lives in the world forward , but as we develop these people stepped back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by strong of a new way of life . 
this is not technology . 
it even Indians called the Sioux with the interest is still in the United States and Indians , people say bye horse and carriage sitting still lives in the United States . 
the threat of intact loop race or change is not technological innovation is power , but idealism his line . 
in Tibet , let &apos;s see where I recently made a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal oppressed . 
and by the genocide in the same race , culture , but denounce extinction , which is the destruction of the people living by without crimes denounce in many places it even as part of their praise strategy . 
if you go to where you have Tibet you can feel the pain . 
and this young man 喇嘛 班禅 皈依 father . 
immediately , he later invasion of Chinese people were killed . 
his uncle and other Nepal to evasive together . 
because mother of his family 富农 is locked up right here , and then when you sit down . 
and he was only two of his mother in which he put quietly skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
just because his sister 学习班 into being and behavior . 
one day she has to be on the head of the hairs have 臂章 to being executed for seven years of a nation 劳教 convicted . 
you won &apos;t let the pain of Tibet with the human spirit redemption need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice is we want to live in a single is still in the world to a world of diversity , 五彩缤纷 
we were there in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 drained that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 era of agriculture into human revolution , we would like to seed 萨满 Beijerinck 腊 by poetry all over the rabbi . we create a level of 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
the modern 三百年 nearly only social industrial history . 
and I think this brief history , we have enough to have the ability to the challenges facing . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility that completely has a : the species that we have to recognize full of race and all of life to prosperity 昌盛 creatures . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern 巴芬岛 of some and then I went to the Inuit , called the narwhals catch 奥拉雅 I tell people about tells a story of his grandfather legendary . 
in the 1950s , Canada , the government is not always being built for the Inuit , and they take our national sovereignty away to settlement . 
this old man migrate to my grandfather . 
he worried about his family , and he put the safety of all the tools and weapons are taken away . 
you know , it &apos;s always the Inuit , and they are this thick of the day . 
their sleds across the North America with the original package 鹿皮 caribou of dry fish was freezing . 
this man , the grandfather of the Arctic don &apos;t fear the 凛冽 and night . 
he slept on the outside , and he was wearing everything leather seal 长裤 he put her hand to pull shit faster stool until the stiffen blades , and he put it into shape . 
and then put it on the edge of manure on spitting 口水 blades , and it becomes very rigid , frozen after having &apos;ve dealt with him to this dog . 
off the dogs bark out and make a pair of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds made to the other thing was , don &apos;t have a dog that put shit knife made in the world . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 life becomes real . 
government Canada April 1999 to an area the size of Texas and California than 之和 returned back to the land to the Inuit , 
I was home , and we called it the Inuit dimensions Le Gavin 
this is a control their territory of independence , where all the ocean . 
this was a very good example of a country that could make a difference to repair it with the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think this ever for some of the world &apos;s people remote places not there . 
because there &apos;s a species as the planet . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids with our own children of the world is the same dream of hope . 
so we have TV and National Geographic by what we do is you don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince others , but we think about the fact that you can get to the world , so we can change the world is the fact about the site of our institutions , a click of thousands of three to five million 
we &apos;re in a 156 channels of the country . 
we had millions of the audience . 
thank you . 
blaise arcas Y aguera photosynth demo of this stunning did this software , watching , we can change the way , using digital images from the picture , a static pick photosynth created a stunning vision , and can navigate the dream of . 
photosynth agueray blaise arcas demo . 
we see here is -- bytes 千兆 and gigabits lots and lots and lots of level , digital photography can make them for the smooth and continuing through , you can zoom in to browse the larger context , and they could rearrange them . 
no matter how many have all the data sets , images images and how big , big itself seadragon all have that kind of processing capability . 
these pictures demonstrate is that most of the photos taken by digital cameras , but this is different from , it is one of the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it &apos;s not different , because the limits of performance system : just factors , what you like the use of the screen . 素数 seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; the chapter is three content . 
I &apos;m going to show you is that this is really not text , images like this , we can do , you can see that it really is a rather text , images . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book that way . 
but I wouldn &apos;t recommend it . 
and here &apos;s one more example , this is an The Guardian . 
every one of the opening one was images did . 
the magazines and newspapers and it involves making multiple versions of the percentage of reading , images , the better get readers experience , reading the joy of reading to enjoy . 
we do here in a small change in The Guardian issues that to the corner . 
we had a figment of high-resolution picture advertising than this -- you just see the normal high resolution of advertising , a lot of extra into the image on the content . 
if you want to see this trait , you can see here . 
you can see , technology , even version of the other dimensions . 
in a way to avoid the limits of the actual use a screen . 
we can reduce technology that would be playing out the window , and the like . 
obviously , for a number of this technology is mapping applications , apps , one of the visible . 
and yet , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made this field for your contribution . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and with overlaid on the road map of the United States . 
now , let &apos;s see , these down the other . 
in fact , this technology already had online experience to myself , and you can imagine . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different : the technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other , graduate students at the University of Washington was conducted snavely noah computer vision of what the research also got at the University of Washington seitz Steve 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski transcribe . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
in this project on the Internet has already applied seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see , we easily to make pictures of multiple ways to , is able to look at the image to have more nuanced and at the resolution to experience . 
in these images , but the three-dimensional folding is actually a very significant . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of this than to place . 
mainly because we build websites , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
DH : be honest , I never thought I would come and work for Microsoft . 
this is really , really exhilarating . 
I think you can see that these images of many different from the camera phones from : the single professional to the camera . so a lot of different picture , by all of quality in this environment in all work together . 
let me get some more images of creepy . 
see , the tourist contains images of 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here is a series of photos -- ah , in here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get the whole to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
the point here is that ? well , we can use online community with everyone . we can get different for each person is going to the environment and gather memory , up to build models . 
and when all of these pictures intertwined menacing , is the only way to take all of them . 
this model of menacing , what is the whole planet . 
this is like the Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people get the use of the complexity , more valuable . 
the user , you will be , a picture that went on the tag . 
thank you very much . 
if I understanding you right , the software that &apos;ll be in the years to come together in 接合 images of the world ? 
the software . this is what &apos;s significant to explore . 
it builds up between images in hypertext . 
this is completely process of 接合 images based on the content . 
the more exciting is that the contains images of text semantic information . 
for example , you go on to what type , the image on the page , and that &apos;s going to be content with a lot of the information in this picture . 
now , with all these pictures , connected image of you ? 
and so , when the information semantic inside and connected to each other &apos;s a huge volumes . this is very typical network effect . 
it &apos;s too , blaise congratulate ! you did . 
thank you very much . 
Barry 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I think I &apos;m here to talk about what part of this book , and it &apos;s hope that you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what the here and I will try to help you put them together . 
I think from a solid credo . 
what kind of creed ? 
that &apos;s what the Western society industrial 笃信 not by a credo . 
this is a credo say this : if we get people to think about the welfare state , its way is to maximize to individual liberty . 
why is that this freedom , which is itself with in the good and valuable , for people need . 
other people , once we have a free , everybody can 做主 ourselves with all the way to get to other people don &apos;t have welfare , 做主 for us . 
the freedom to be a big enough to do is increase the selectivity . 
the more choices of people that freedom , freedom , the more you get , the more it also benefits of the more . 
I think , like the idea of our into so that when you add it in the water that deep-seated presumption that nobody would like to think about this question . 
and the same deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of social contemporary look forward to development had become , we can do things . 
this is a my local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
you see , this is the supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a pop-up stores one acoustic system -- a configuration that includes a CD , blah , blah . an amplifier 磁带机 , radio , and that &apos;s a pop-up stores one in which sound system countless more . 
with this store , you can components of the last out with the combination of 650万种 to sound system in 3D . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , let &apos;s talk about communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to it , telephone service Bell Maya to that , only company a company . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually died at the phone , it &apos;s not all bad . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
now I &apos;m almost infinite variety of mobile phone , especially -- it shows . 
these are the future of the cell phone . 
and I &apos;d love to that in the middle is the same MP3 with -- playing machine , a nose forming a brownish caramel French and cut hair 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t on your side of the shops , if seen with no , don &apos;t worry about how you will see . 
this is the outcome , people running into shops asking : thank you so much with no one has a function of ? 
you want , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now you may not have to buy that so many do not one of the cell phone . 
again , in some other than the life of a shopping thing affecting us for this , on the explosion of choice . 
in the United States -- health care is not gone . now , you go to the doctor , who do so , how do you tell the time . 
instead , you had to be a doctor , where doctors say to you : we can use cure nail 乙 , you can use it . 
and so forth , and I have nail solution risk . 
and so forth , and I have 乙 solution risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say to me , Doctor “ : how do ” ? 
they say that again , these are nail 乙 risk , and I have the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask “ doctor : I was going to you , Doctor , that you chose ” ? 
doctor : you are not me , but “ ” . 
now the recipe , all the pharmaceutical ad is for you . the ordinary people that I think about it , if you say , it isn &apos;t . and since we buy counter to directly . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , we hope that they advertise . look at the next morning , go back to my doctor prescribed to let the doctors , called the drugs on them . 
now , we like the gender of the identity of this kind of choices that are like that . let me try to this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we could get to the gender of indelibly identity . 
it also means that you wake up every morning you have to do to you today about what a male and female is still of the decision . 
in the past , in terms of family marriage everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age is , of course , is that then 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need to choose the is who and what is not married , when I got married , and it &apos;s not what to do next . 
and now , this whole thing could pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart and good students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework for almost one . 
it &apos;s not because they were so stupid -- of students , and it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
why are they now brains are filled with all sorts of things , and I ask myself , what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? connected now to be ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to kids , and I knew things ? 
this is the 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they do not do is I assign homework , and also in my class and they take what grades . 
they really wanted to go to this problem , because these are all important question . 
now do work , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , we can make progress in one day , any time of the Earth in a corner -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
this , but actually in restaurants WiFi can have a place , but I don &apos;t tell you , in which . 
don &apos;t tell you that the reason is , I also want to use . 
anyway , we believe that the work that we have freedom of choice is the kind of choices we had to make decisions , again , again , again , for their work now is to break moved . 
we went to see a kid play football , the mobile phone with the 裤兜 another , with the 裤兜 blackberry and BlackBerry or lap , with the laptops . 
even though they were locked up , we are looking at the rivals for the kids are constantly ask yourself , the phone that link or not ? 
back in the back -- still not email ? should I wrote this 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself , you don &apos;t think the answer is that the child to the experience of the game is also a . severely compromised . 
look around , whether it &apos;s still a big , long way life is also a matter of choice is life . 
we live in the past . this is the world . 
that means , choice is still there , but nothing is not to have choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know the benefits of it . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these choices for people , there are two and a negative impact on the two . 
one , to say something up , which is , an oxymoron . it &apos;s not that we give free , but inside , is we numb . 
with so many choices to find people make decisions , very difficult . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , and that &apos;s a plan pension waiting for about investing in terms of research . 
a colleague of mine came in contact with vanguard vanguard of investment . to record is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million people in the office 000多个 , two and a place . 
and that is , when surveyed report to their employees and customers -- every species of that helps fund 10 increase the to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to provide 50种 fund , provided you people than the five foundations , down ? why 10 percent . 
because facing to fund 50种 choices to choose to think that it &apos;s even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow halide , of course , you tomorrow , tomorrow &apos;s never going to come . 
no . wait for it to every year , they make up from subsidies symmetrical employer 5千元 溜掉 手边 employer . this is actually provide are obsessed with the subsidies . 
so many choices , possibilities and the result is numb . 
it makes it look like this into our world and in this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make the decision is the right , right ? 
where you don &apos;t want to pick it helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the more likely to feel something for inexplicably regret . this is one , to make yourself happy is not always a choice . 
and second , is what economists call ” “ opportunity cost of things . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert enough of a told us , is a watch that depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when you choose to have a lot of people think , is very easy to imagine that you gave up the choice of many of you , and that makes you like to think that the chosen 美中不足 . 
so , for example , it shows that if you didn &apos;t have the New York , my first 歉 a dish . 
but this is what you want to be right now . 
look at these two 口子 the Hamptons . 
expensive , in the rich . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
more than that can also ? good at this guy , huh “ think they &apos;re really bad , is now “ ” ” , in August . 
all of your neighbors “ Manhattan , not home ” 
I “ is going to stop can go back to the door of my own ” . 
and two weeks , he was such an idea in every day , and torture 念叨 lost the parking , so that &apos;s an opportunity . 
always ” “ opportunity cost for us to make a decision that &apos;s not actually decided that even with a remarkable . 
we have the option in these choices , the more attractive , the more things which are the things that opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also said the ” present “ . it &apos;s probably going to get things done . 
one of them , but the truth is , when you choose to do something , you can also do not have chosen the other thing . 
the other thing that tend to have a lot of you to decrease , and where are you doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
I once had at this point to buy a new jeans when I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
that &apos;s jeans , in the past , you buy a car inappropriate pants , come back , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in the long enough time to wash them , and after several times 凑合 get pants . 
so , this years old in the street to finally , I had to buy the new . I said , I want to feed “ jeans , this is one of my ” sizes . 
you say , and the type of comfort , to the type of sweatpants , or is it ? 
to the front of his buttons . the lockset is still the 石磨 ? the wash acid , or is it ? 
to kind of breaking grinds faster ? 
it &apos;s also , the back of his mouth , and asked to 喋喋不休 . 
my jaw , almost off . and I got over , ask me , I &apos;m going to “ is used to that is the only one ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , I took the place I pair of pants 合身 stores out the door . 
I don &apos;t really have to do this wrong . I had to do better . 
but even worse , but in your mind . 
and I &apos;m here for ? why specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , is the reason is because of this to me , sexual choice but to a jeans exactly what the best be warmer greatly expectations . 
I was very low expectations . when it jeans , a so much that I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , at best , huh , there &apos;s a perfect economy . 
and that &apos;s a really nice , but it isn &apos;t perfect . 
so I have , I had to go and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expect that I , it becomes disappointing . 
in the lives of people together , except that what we can actually to improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond how offer people didn &apos;t benefit . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
the market do not know the truth . because if they understand people &apos;s inside the , you wouldn &apos;t have to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all the bad things all over the last better than today . 
the reason is , when one of the things that are not good for people to experience that might have some surprises . 
now , that we in the industrialized , wealthy world of civic life is already , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it only has more than you would expect . 
you will never be what you because , you know what I than expectations of God . 
what is the secret of happiness is that , to come here today , you know , the secret of happiness is : high expectations , don &apos;t 知足常乐 . 
and I think it , let &apos;s take a little bit of time , I married my wife . now , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
I didn &apos;t it a try , I 凑合 . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in a shop for jeans hundreds of choice you bought a pair of , you don &apos;t think back to ask you , happy , who &apos;s responsibility for what ? 
now this is obviously the answer the question is : you . 
you can do better . 
on the right there , you have no excuse jeans hundreds of making things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions to decide that even when the result is that they have very good about it , disappointed -- decided to blame myself . 
in the past us in this generation -- developed countries -- industrialized world , in clinical explosive growth is depressed . 
and finally , the net effect on the object , even though , is that we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t look like from the front . 
I remind you . 
this led to the well-being of creed , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s not completely wrong . right . 
there &apos;s no choice but to choose , choose predictions are that you can &apos;t more is better . 
there &apos;s a critical value , I don &apos;t know how many . 
but I knew we certainly can ‘ far beyond what we choose the richest and the key to ’ value . 
I said . here is a policy question , we should think about the problem is a policy that we give , industrialized society , the choices that so many of the matter is enormously rich . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world that we , at least we heard a few of them , there &apos;s no problem , too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies of the wealth of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 , said that yesterday &apos;s question indignant , is that we do it again and expensive car seats , the baby 于事无补 in just a waste of money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is that the complicated , expensive 于事无补 is not only choice . 
in fact , they gave us . 
they actually makes us from not as before . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve the way . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of our problems , like the plague of choice . 
the end , you should look at this cartoon , and the guy in a position to say , this fish , huh “ know what ? 
to tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting , this is the interpretation . 
and yet , the more I thought it was obvious that the fish , what we know for sure . 
so if you want to be honest , because everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get the paralysis , it &apos;s not freedom to fish and die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you have increased the is is reduced , paralyzed . 
everyone needs a ” “ fish . 
and in this fish -- for this fish , it &apos;s possible for us , something a little almost certainly is too small . 
so there &apos;s no , but a fraction of the fish will be suffering and that means is , maybe , to disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about some of the project in the human genome , and they found a new and . the meaning of the genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of biology digitized . and now we &apos;re trying to do from the digital code to a new kind of biological design , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I want to keep on many biologists are in a different level in trying to understand the problem . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now we have almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we in the human genome sequence from it , the analysis analog in biology , computer September the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life from , or whether we can create the world , the number of new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . to have it , as a species , the smallest genome to make it replicate themselves in the lab , we &apos;re trying to understand . and if we could find a smaller genome . 
we have to separate out of genetic 500组 一百组 . this is the front of us . 
so , the only thing that we can continue the way is to study these synthetic chromosome so we can change its these questions to continue part of the most basic questions . 
so we started to walk along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
we allow really chemical principle that we never succeeded in making these molecules displayed ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , is just , by the way of living with some chemicals . 
our digital life constantly faster . faster exponentially . 
we wrote to the genetic code , and very slow to progress , but also the increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
and it actually for the first stage . we do in front of the trials conducted the first , a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
the world &apos;s 十几万台 device in the little pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 , and this is a far back to the manufacturing process , the more than that , the more it wrong . 
so we had to create a new way of these little put together in emissions than all the mistakes and correct . 
this is our first attempt , from Phi X 174 number of phage and genome to information . 
that &apos;s a small bacteria kills virus . 
we designed it , the gene was wrong with that , correct symbol 5,000 a length of DNA . 
the other stages of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live of chemicals , the bacteria into the genetic code , access to the bacteria made the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill a different and E. coli 兰氏 negative HIV-infected . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , and I think they communicate this model to understand the very well . 
he was laughing out loud , more than you . 
so we thought that software is actually in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you use to the computer in digital information . that this digital information has to be very accurate . 
when we first in 1995 for this group of subjects , gene sequencing standard for basic 10,000 every is a mistake . 
in fact , we found that the sequence again on average , it &apos;s 30 mistakes . if we use the sequence of this , probably never gene is turned on . 
design is part of the work of character 50 design and fragments of the other and footage of a character that 50 percent of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can come together . 
we have one of the design of unique . 
you may have heard of in our 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 modestly -- and the way these scripts like about 20 amino acids , there are amino acids every mark a character . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , verbal mind . 
first , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we didn &apos;t do it with a poem . 
and that the design we can use the bias enzyme which cuts . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from 70 length of time to put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time and pull out , merging than 10,000 , 72 into a long time . 
each of us on the stage , so that they can give us a sequence , because we wanted to create a very reliable process that you will see in a minute . 
we try to get to automate the level . 
it looks like a map 对阵 篮球赛 . 
when these very big piece for almost 100 million people , when they &apos;re hard to keep the coil E. in the long , long more in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair the DNA , put it into a piece . 
here &apos;s an example of a tolerance called microbes 三百万度 球菌 able to afford the radiation dose radiation . 
you can see the views on top of it , the everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , the original before . 
we can do this , there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes . they can be completely out of water in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , life there , moving around and water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown that a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of molecules that we shot by those images microscopic . that &apos;s actually , the process of what &apos;s going to put it into yeast , and the way we design right through the yeast . they will automatically , essentially . 
this is not an electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just the regular optics microscope . 
so this is a big molecule that we can look at it with a optics microscope . 
these are the 六秒 for about a long time . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is a far more than the genetic code 580000 . this is by humans setting the manufacturing and structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t 10-point font , depending on the will require total . printed 142页 to print the genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do a very simple more complicated . 
we like to deal with that kind of itself as you can take a relatively simple into another , and then the nucleus of cells , and this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they 连成 cells with the entire chromosomes , but we also recently , very clear that we can do a whole genome to transplanting cells from one another to activate it and the cell . 
the new cells into the chromosomes . 
in fact , we thought that just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to design process that some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second or species of chromosome from elsewhere in the chromosome , the third one second of the thousands and thousands of new feature to its own . 
what people were held in the process of evolution , every time it would have a genetic change the perception of the biological ignoring the realities . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited to the enzyme digesting the DNA . 
the chromosome out of the cell that no and enzymes that no enzyme when we think this is a into the chromosomes . 
it did work out , and out of the chromosome is no matter , it is to digest , finally , we have a new contains cell of DNA . 
we put it into the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all completely , and disappeared into a new species , based on the cells in our new software “ ” . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , they change -- when we reading the genetic code , and it is in fact , that we will implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can actually move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I want to say that this is not the genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do this ? 
I think we need for some reason , that &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from the nine billion into 65亿 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people on each of us from 1946 ; people there in the next 40 years , they become the four . 
we &apos;re giving people 65亿 for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult for all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people which 捉襟见肘 . 
we use 300多亿桶 50亿顿 over the oil , coal . it &apos;s a day . 10 . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace or any of the program , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is the material that by the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
now we have found from around the world in a database of genetic 两千万组 about , and I like to see them as the future of design components . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry , attached to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
the main our current biological limits from us and reality of the imagination . 
we now have the technology that can produce these because that is , what we call the mixing “ ” group to synthesize the very , very quickly . 
what we have the ability to make a larger robot made every day we can make a chromosome . 
and this is just the standard choose to live in . and we can choose to produce biofuels , or chemical production vaccine , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that we actually sit in a computer in working with really designed to software design of species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code , and they look like . 
we focus on the ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you will see recently into corn ethanol is just a bad trial . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . fuel into higher value of fuel , for example , or different types of 辛烷 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
is CO2 and sunlight -- one way of doing that . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is something that was in 1996 , microbes . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane , translated into the molecules of its energy source . 
we looked at whether to collect their two of them , and then you can very easily , standing processing over into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may be able to increase the life , &quot; What ? &quot; and the basic question of understanding . 
we have a really good replacing the whole oil industry , the little target . and if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there are these ? might be a major sources . 
and we are using tools made out of the same instant vaccine . 
this year to see all of you have the flu , we &apos;re always going in and time of year , the lack of money , when the vaccine useful . 
I think it was made by can be to change the vaccine mix . 
this is the future are going to probably change with the evolutionary tree , now , as a synthetic bacteria , the species have such an artifact for , and that is accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a farther away from human to improve the lives of our . the goal is to make sure we get to the long enough to live longer -- maybe you can do it . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox shares some which are super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
in the last year I speak at TED , the LHC . 
and I said , you give back to the machines running on to update reality . 
and here it is , if you don &apos;t last year , to the LHC is in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in the universe reinventing the billionth of a second per second state of this state and began to make . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva underground mechanical . 
we give them with a camera the Big Bang . 
this is the inaugural I work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas of see a spectacular scale . 
last September 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a picture of the photos atlas 
it was just danced in the control room 
and this is the first picture of particles clusters along the way , as we all around the LHC with plans of , part of the LHC in particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in a scene that we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a big success . 
I don &apos;t know this is a -- this is also 满堂喝彩 when people go to the icons , if I see Google , like this . 
this suggests that we work with this shock cultural caused a lot of research on the same . 
but after a week about some of our machines with these major faulty 导线 导线 about -- the gold . 
and when the current 安培 more conduction 导线 all machine . 
now some of you might say , an engineer , could not “ too narrow ” these wires . 
they can do it , because when they &apos;re very little 导线 superconducting . 
and so on the planet 271摄氏度 below minus the space between these cases of heat conduction can 导线 so strong of electricity . 
at the LHC of 接点 九千多个 电磁铁 in one of the technology to install a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises a little bit more of the transmission it lead to sudden current 安培 by resistance 
this is . 
very shocking , because those magnets move them material it weighs about a mile ruler . 
we have about 50 magnets impaired . 
and unloaded , put them to work done . 
we gave them joy , fix . 
now , they come back into the ground . 
by the LHC left at three in refer again . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July , we continue to data and get out of the mission of the most basic units in the universe . 
now obviously , one of these accidents . so , again , about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s still too difficult task , but in fact , the pursuit of our projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
thank you . 
Elizabeth Gilbert . 呵护 about stress make attenuate and creativity . 
I &apos;m a writer , I was just writing , the more career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , I was just writing , the more career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , I was just writing , the more career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
nonetheless , in my recent work life , in a special happened recently , in spite of events in my life working in a special happened , I have to make things , and I think again about the relationship between my work . 
now , it turns out to me , no matter where I think all people , all this . this is now , it turns out to me , no matter where I think all people , and that &apos;s life . 
and so , really , really play , saved 完了 ! 
they would be very anxious to say , I came to “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you did not beyond all the book that ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people ! 
I also met around at the question , people say , you don &apos;t worried that may not work ? 
you not afraid to continue to be bearing down upon you ? 
you end up in the dream of fragmented filled with despair , died in the center of failure , I was always get something like that question . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , this kind of people who make everything else today . 
yes , this kind of people who make everything else today . 
well beyond that , I don &apos;t know a lot of people fearful into something that is beyond that , I don &apos;t know a lot of other things . 
for example , the grass , and there are other things . 
but , writing afraid to say , recently I &apos;ve been wondering , why am I ? writing afraid to say , but I was writing , recently , I &apos;ve always wondered why writing fear ? 
this is the reason is an idea ? 
people fear of destined yourself doing this work ? people fear ? logical destined yourself doing the work ? logical that ? 
nobody says that chemical , John “ : working with the bottlenecks ” ? how ? 
could never asked this happened . 
of course , that engineers chemical 平心而论 , not just in the last few centuries , drunk and depressed 狂躁 享誉 addiction , not in the past few centuries , due to alcoholism , and depression , addiction 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early last century , with great fields 英年早逝 geniuses at the case for early last century , with great fields 英年早逝 geniuses gently age is often the case to die of suicide . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t even talent , their shows that the suicide , no , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent 
Noam 曼梅 , before he died in the last time I said , in every book “ 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
in your life &apos;s work , and this is how aggressive . 
today I want to ask : is any of you are no dispute about that ? I &apos;m going to be asked in the room for all of you , is that no other questions ? 
you think that I had no idea from a even ? problem further to look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in species . 
this is not only 可憎 , terrible , and I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 , terrible , and I don &apos;t want this idea that goes down to the last century , and not only opinion , terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses create more will live . 
and I myself , believed that I will inevitably , due to the dark in , and I myself , believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage now in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was a young age to 40 to me , you see , I was a young age to 40 to me . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and frankly , we have to look at the time , I said , quote , heart out of friends , potentially , right , I was the biggest in the past success . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
so , this idea is that people who took a drink 大清早 drank -- not the way back to this idea is , well , one on the road to 大清早 drank way back to the wine -- I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to go and I want to do what I love writing career , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing career , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
and in my mind , it seems to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protection . 
I have to do it in a way , to build a safe distance from writing itself , and I work for the responses from writing is extremely anxiety , and I work for the extreme anxiety received . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greeks and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we sent back to be the last question . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 unknowable and distant from place to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable unknowable and distant from purpose to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called this to universal creativity of all , to come to 精灵 ” stewards for “ 
and people often think Socrates stewards for a there , he gave away from general wisdom was that people think that &apos;s Socrates stewards for an intelligent gives him from a distance . 
the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius “ called 精灵 ” , the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius “ called 精灵 ” 
this is a view of Rome , because that is a particularly ” “ genius of intelligent people , because of a little idea that people don &apos;t think of Roman “ genius is a particularly intelligent ” personal . 
it &apos;s amazing , this is what I was looking at this safe distance work from people , let &apos;s 成败 affected by mental . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by the artist ancient conservation , get and the idea of avoided by artists ancient narcissistic . and this idea of narcissistic . avoid . 
if you work great . that &apos;s because you don &apos;t fully to the fact is , you know you &apos;re in a glass of ” “ genius of work done . 
if you work , also , very bad at it , you &apos;re not all wrong . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you ” very bad “ genius . 
this is in the last Westerners in time for a long way of looking at creativity 
and I &apos;m saying is that I think , is a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes , the sun swallow one-nth of vulnerability for this , is too big . 
this was completely down one &apos;s perception , and the expansion of the great achievement personal for this line of a distorted completely cognitive self , and for people to the expansion of the great achievement . 
I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years , I think artists countless get this pressure , which is in the last 500 years devouring many artist . 
if this is really , I think , at least we so that &apos;s the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should be the oldest more to go back to the past , for their reference that with human understanding of creativity ? maybe we should be the oldest more to go back to the past , for their reference that with human understanding of creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , the 18 minutes off question-asking 500多年 develops ideas of the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , the 18 minutes off question-asking 500多年 develops ideas humanities rational . 
maybe I could not convince you of what I agree with you . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why not ? thinking differently , but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , trying to create a for any of you sitting in that people have been all through this process will know it &apos;s not always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s exposed to make sense 
like a breath of on her head down emptying . 
she could feel it came to this because , 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it came to this because , 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing , and she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
in some of the most is that , when I call the memorable , in other parts : is this , my name is the most amazing part , and she said , there are almost her 错过 poem . 
and she &apos;s on the other hand , grab the tail of a poem that get it back on the other hand , the 誊写 poetry to put it on paper , get back to the other hand , poetry on paper in 誊写 
every poem , this will intact , which is in reverse order , except on paper , from the beginning , by the last word , go back to the first words . 
I heard her story and , like this , it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not the creative process , I don &apos;t I , all of my work , is more like a so . 
but even as 古板 accident , sometimes I get to , even though the idea of an incredible 古板 will occasionally , I like to get an accident . 
and maybe a lot of people who sat in a similar experiences . 
you want , like me even 墨守成规 will also , people don &apos;t know where inspiration comes to you that I like even , 墨守成规 will also , people don &apos;t know where inspiration . 
what was going on here ? 
how do we want to see the way , it will not only ? rational loss in how we &apos;re looking at it , don &apos;t have lost rational ? 
he was eager to capture it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder , and the pen and paper eagerly him to capture it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder , and the pen and paper

he looked up to the sky , and she said , it &apos;s about “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , I was driving ? ” he looked up to the sky , “ said : it for you , I &apos;m sorry , I can &apos;t see ” driving ? 
he looked up to the sky , and she said , it &apos;s about “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , I was driving ? is it looks like I ” immediately you can get a piece of look like ?

since then , after the creative process of Tom change . 
it &apos;s not a piece of work , he still is completely dark . 
and he was able to inspiration from the outside the unknown between the strange and weird and wonderful inspiration relationship to the outside it and he &apos;s at least between the strange and weird and wonderful relationship with the outside , it &apos;s a itself . 
this story , pernicious job . I changed the way , this transformation has saved me this story , pernicious job . I changed the way , this transformation has saved me again . 
and , worst is not only is completely shit , I began to think I should give up wrote this book . 
and , worst is not only is completely shit , I began to think I should give up wrote this book . 
and then I remembered , shouting God to Tom that , and then I tried and tried to Tom reminds me of the day , shouting that , and then I tried to .

that &apos;s a performance , because they were great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they are a great dancer professional . 
occasionally , though , but see very little indeed a something will happen to dancers 出世 transcendent , and beyond 
you know that I should say that because you &apos;ve all seen , at some point the performance . 
time to stop a dancer , as time went dancer , stop it seems like he did across the before and movement of the performance 1000场 all but different , and amazingly , it all together . 
impressed , he &apos;s not a normal human inside of his life , from the light from the bottom of light . 
impressed , he &apos;s not a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , by his light from the bottom of the sacred shine . 
clearly , people know what it is , they can call it the name of the time , people know exactly what it is , they can name it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles phenotype . 
in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of : all are cheering you on your way to “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , Alabama , that &apos;s great , great really amazing , and that &apos;s miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , is the tricky 悠悠 dancer , the next morning , turn to wake up , artists , is the tricky 悠悠 dancer , the next morning , that is already turned waking up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , he was no longer miracles phenotype . 
and that &apos;s only when bad leg , are going to go to the old , and mortals maybe he couldn &apos;t reach the height of that last night . 
maybe he was never dance with miracles all are cheering you on your way since he was going to do ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the most of my pain of cognitive self . 
this is a very hard question , which is my most of the pain of cognitive self , this is a very hard question , which is the most of my pain of cognitive self . 
but perhaps , we would have thought that if you were never thought of that , starting from completely art you if you were never thought of hell , you come from completely art . 
if we think about that changed everything .

hold in your , whatever you jobs , if you : what is a dancer dance like that . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs , if you : what is a dancer dance like that . 
which , if you don &apos;t keep jobs you hold , dance , and I still kept for you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
which , if you don &apos;t keep jobs you hold , dance , and I still kept for you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
I believe that we have to teach it . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you know , 嘞 ! 
from TED in the Al Gore , on the global climate think , is the new trend worth more than about the prophecy scientists , and that for his ” “ clean coal . 
the trends and climate recently for Al Gore warning . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 past in the area of South America by the equivalent of reducing the total area 48 state 40 percent . 
but these were not able to completely because it is not that the thickness of ice cap . 
like the polar ice cap -- just like the global climate system beating heart . 
in the summer , and actually hyperextending heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of a sequel . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in every winter is the dark blue into the annual ice formed in the summer ice was freezing context . 
the so-called ” was freezing permanent “ form , I &apos;m talking about the long or five years of ice , and you can see , this body to move blood like 各部 guy . 
in the 25 years , it &apos;s time to here , from here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and by was freezing . 干冰 carbon clean from microbes , defrost methane . 
if the breakthrough , something is going to greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of Alaska in shallow water can see already in Lake went out of that . 
last winter , at the professor of alaska 结队 walter katey light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s we , right ? 
the reason , there &apos;s a massive heat heating the sink Greenland . 
the last year , this is a river . 
but that doesn &apos;t flow in 往年 . 
this is the southwest Greenland kangerlussuaq river . 
if you want to know how to melt onto the ice of sea level rise to the mouth of the Nung it is here . 
there are dramatic rise of traffic . 
the Earth , the planets and the other end of the biggest on the ice . 
last month , the report scientists are in the continents and reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the sea , 20 feet and Greenland . 
in the third largest , himalayas ice in the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from the other half get water molten drinking water . 
in the Andes , the ice is the city of drinking water . 
increase in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to fire and dry more numbers . 
and the world &apos;s population in absolute disaster is kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , in relation to the earlier disaster 七十五年 number four . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the past five years of the day we added CO2 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions to the oceans . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India on the continent time dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
the biggest problems of forest destruction , except for 20 percent of the oil fuel is burning . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together and China . 
the solution is to use to build a planet of carbon -- coal more . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change of the ocean . 
here &apos;s what &apos;s the new some and some of the green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and in the oil industry and carbon -- coal have spent the last year 两千五百万美元 to promote the contradiction that &apos;s clean coal . 
that &apos;s what I remembered . 
before Christmas , Tennessee in my hometown of billions of years to muck up the coal . 
you probably saw on the news 
here , the second largest put up the waste water . 
this is what happens before Christmas of 
there &apos;s a kind of carbon -- coal advertising industry . 
Mr. cool coal is happy , happy . 
in the United States , you can see him , more productive , we also helped him about economic development . 
Mr. cool coal in every single day more healthy . 
he workers for , sanctuary cute to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s the west virginia , a lot of our original coal . 
most of the head is the coal mining massey 
so Al Gore and Alliance for Climate is one of the current and are starting ancillary two projects . 
this is one part of one of them . 
in very seriously , we coalergy treated the cause us to climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money with our initial goal and tried to understand the coal version of the truth . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , is it smells good quality . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about and global warming . 
let &apos;s do it . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at the average art as a clean coal factory . 
spectacular 喧哗 some machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burning coal with global warming is the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now a clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to challenge the national security and economic challenge 
the economic crisis is in the United States , national security , climate crisis . 
these are crisis in strings together for us is the carbon based on the product of oil dependency on imported dirty , such as the oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solutions to solving these problems . 
with america repower clean 100 percent of the last 10 years of electricity . 
the ability to work for life , we make safe , and more on the Earth isn &apos;t global warming . 
eventually , a large enough of the solutions to our problems . 
america repower know more . 
the final 
this is about repower america . 
with the dirtiest oil in the murder of our planet to reduce we let it &apos;s dependent on its way . 
the future . here &apos;s the wind and solar energy , a new network . 
the investment of creating a new kind of money . 
when I was america repower ! it &apos;s wishes come true . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want to leave you with as you think about the playing with Legos . 
when you idea how to build with Legos and the hands-on to is actually , when you &apos;re learning how to solve the problem with thinking . that &apos;s the thing about perceiving and understanding the 空间结构 . 
to understand the object to help us very 空间结构 around a lot of learning things . 
so the question that I danced in the mind , so we decided to find the answer , it &apos;s so siftables . 
in short , siftable interaction , which is a computer , which cookie as well . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 , moving siftable can move each other &apos;s perception of each other , and to monitor and siftable 每块 radio device . 
most importantly , it &apos;s a siftable 每块 like , you can , same building blocks . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital tools of information . 
this is much more sensitive , independent more tools to each other , with any sense , the perception of mobile , so we can use this tool to try something new , interesting interaction . 
now , I like to show some simple . 
this is siftable reflection , if I put it side to it , so it &apos;s the image that we &apos;re facing over here , if I put it in the opposite direction . so , it &apos;s in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put out a 挨 a funny , good things happen . 
if you give them a free , they will have noticed , which will have a mess . 
they can lean and move each other &apos;s perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like for example , the color that liquid backwards from one another pour siftable siftable . 
we look at this , that there are three sets of patterns to paint barrels siftables , we can put these bucket of color pour in the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if you can , a lot falls back down . 
the machine learning and siftables function , can be used to wait arithmetic count , language -- we want to make these functions through learning to see more quickly , on-the-spot results . 
this is also , I &apos;m here to show why siftables -- it &apos;s me with a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
these words siftables can play a game -- and scrabble boggle remix of games . 
this word together as a game , you just take the letter with a siftable with dollars , when you put together the letters siftables of words , the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of the right word , letters , you can try to put the letters in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , on the screen in the Media Lab . some kids are involved in the test siftables kids put my experience , the experience of the process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is to build this playing the game words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , this is a word spell “ ” game , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the lower right here is the age of experience . 
he just wants to put together in a pile of siftables . 
in his mind , is just siftables kit . 
now , of the screen to interact with the function of animation . 
we want to be able to siftables tool of language . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new graphics to add elements , and he does is siftables table to pick up some graphics towards a video , you can put that in animation to add elements . 
see , he came up to the sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David tractors add up to him . 
in orange . 
the good ! 
the shake graphics siftables towards a new can bring the image to add elements to his new add elements 吠 dog -- going up . 
he wrote in animation . he &apos;s in the story . 
hello ! 
this is an open the end of story , how did this project in his story . 
cat sitting balloon off . 
I &apos;m going to show you one last to give you a function of this , even more recently , we were playing siftables , the R &amp; D in this capability of the sound domain , can make 超载 note , the sound of drums and Bess . 
everyone has tiles , regulate and 四档 任君 choice . 
you can think of the modules sound to sound editors siftable in the tiles siftable hit you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors near tiles tiles . 
there is something like a sound filter , which 响器 siftable role of the modules . 
this kind of put tiles sound near tiles that you can adjust to sound . 
so , can control your rhythm and volume of the modules editor near tiles siftable siftable to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
the first started with two editors 超载 note , and some tiles 超载 note . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 of sound . 
now put tiles Drums near tiles sound filter , so you can adjust sound . 
I just put some faster pace tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now , and the shellfish near tiles sound filter filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can also . 
so don &apos;t need it , even in advance , all based on play , but long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with , play the entire volume edited near tiles , tiles on the left with this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you can see , I was able to develop a new kind of human-computer interaction with better medium of the brain works . 
today , I &apos;m showing you this in a study siftable , we are in the next to the lab . 
I want to talk to you in the idea is that we developed a new generation cutting-edge technology -- can 接轨 digital media and the technology to bring to the world , it would change this revolution in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect about shared with you .
