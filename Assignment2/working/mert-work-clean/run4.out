images and stories through rapture , for National Geographic by Wade Davis celebrated explorers indigenous people around the world of the culture , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate disappear from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same kind of flexible rule . 
and we &apos;re born 生儿育女 母腹 in the world 
we have of the week . 
生离死别 cruel to deal with the singing and dancing , so we have in our lives 排遣 苦楚 art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture has a rhythm and dance songs of the unique identity . 
we have all of a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you send will now be thinking that you see the future . 
the world in a culture of 五彩缤纷 犹如 by mental life and culture web of life , covered the whole planet it had a very important 芸芸众生 , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , as we are at a very powerful symbol of species . 
and by the biosphere as a child facing the same as in the end of the destruction , and it faster . 
this one is the most important language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
flash is the human spirit . 
it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the dictionary 承 around the world . 
each one of the language that &apos;s an ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate . 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language and the number of people like us in the audience , half of that has no language to teach kids . 
that &apos;s not the language of 传人 act , unless they &apos;re going to be completely gone . 
imagine if you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last thing you can &apos;t 本族语 through the wisdom of our children are not allowed to predict the future of how that can be lonely and scary . 
and in fact , it &apos;s a terrible about every two weeks of the Earth is going to be one of the 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore this race on for about race to give you a rough , and you come to die in a sense of civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot . I said , &quot; ” “ in front of a different way of living , and I said “ ” different way of living . 
the children , for example , in the Bala Northwest 亚玛逊 pull 蚺 that they &apos;re called area of a political race because they believe that they were born in 米尔克 coming from the sacred river for . 
you can &apos;t tell the difference between the groups of people in the blue and green is because of them in their 栖身 天穹 , so it doesn &apos;t have to the forest canopy . 
they say , a strange kind of language and follow the rules of the unique 异族 通婚 通婚 called went to one of the people to get a different language . 
this is based on the history of mythology and you can see through a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador 华拉尼 genocide is the most amazing people , one of the genocide in 1958 , my first year they had used to work with peace . 
five year 1957 their preacher , but these people to make a mistake . 
they came from eight to leave the 十张 pictures of himself , and we think it &apos;s nice , but they don &apos;t think that these people who live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they picked up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through of trying to find these people what they found , but it &apos;s coming , so they don &apos;t think this is called the Devil . and they use it with five 戮 preacher . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying external 戮 华拉尼 people die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
we found only to investigate 宗谱 一个八代 两例 刨根问底 nature , and they die out , and the old people being the wood is going to do when he died , and they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have astonishing forest 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 smell urine , the animals , and they know what it is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand it . I have to figure out the magic and voodoo teach religion -- how teaching voodoo thing is the magic of a dark . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the most important in the world will give you some examples of religion . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about living in , and it &apos;s the connection between 
in living soul . 
the rhythm of the dance 大水 can tap a soul would try to replace the birth of the soul in this short for 侍僧成 shining moment . 
so , voodoo who say you go to church worship like to call God . 
as we know the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
and in some of my life in the northern in Colombia 玛尔塔 科基人 mountains of the most remarkable . 
this is the ancient species , they were civilization tyranny at Columbia and to the coast of occupation , in the Caribbean plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast in plain isolated . 
across the globe in this bloody this race to the people who have never been seen Spain . 
and that &apos;s going on today , they will monks 续 rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
back in their community 母腹 taught the values that maintain around these values , and that is the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s a beautiful , you want to protect it . 
they call themselves as we call it lies over , we are in the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
it &apos;s not going to 多愁善感 Aboriginal people would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain , or just a bunch of 矿石 . it &apos;s not important . 
this is important for the meaning of a relationship with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , by the local people in the mind , I think is going to be logging . 
if you look at this point , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , and you &apos;ll understand how different life . 
and this picture is this past August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 俗称 斯卡藤 die on many of you have heard of it is a very strong component of plants work to make it 萨满教 徒 die on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent of color dopamine , and it &apos;s in the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 from people tribes serotonin , plants extract the nose and continuing . 
if you take a powder in these hallucinations , these wacky , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s not your 荡然无存 distorted . 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
dopamine to oral these color , and it &apos;s for oral substance to change the dopamine in the rest of the 氧化酶 chemicals . 
this is interesting in the β 藤本植物 啉 -- there was going to be able to control 咔 氧化酶 dopamine agonists color , and the power to everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
when we do all kinds of experiments are wrong to measure . 
but if you ask Indians will say they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
people have found 科凡 tribes in the cane is that they all die in the deep jungle found in our species , they &apos;re different . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , &quot; I want you to have some plants . 
you know , there &apos;s some plants , and I said , it &apos;s not . 
they said that I told you , and that night in the months to circle around each one of the different plants , in the singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s better than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem that some of us with indigenous people that compassion 离群索居 enrich their lives , but as we develop these people in the world in step forward to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by strong of a new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians , even though it &apos;s still with the Indians interest to the horse and carriage , and there &apos;s still live in the United States . 
the threat is not race or change intact technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we &apos;ll see in Tibet , where I recently made a lot of research , where you can see some authoritarian political . 
and by the genocide in the same race , culture , but it &apos;s opinion . it &apos;s the way of life . but crimes no denunciations , in many places , it might even be a part of this as a strategy praise . 
if you go to where you can feel pain with Tibet . 
this young man 班禅 皈依 喇嘛 father . 
immediately after the invasion of his people were killed . 
and the rest of his uncle to displacement together in Nepal . 
because my mother , his family 富农 is locked up right here , and then when you sit down . 
there are only two , and he and his mother quietly in skirts and and took him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister , and by the 学习班 offends behavior . 
she didn &apos;t have to be with Mau on the face of print 臂章 to being executed for seven years of 劳教 nation . 
it &apos;s the pain of Tibet with redemption we need to get to see . 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve existed in the &apos; 60s , and has drained we feel guilty . 
entering the era of human 新石器 agriculture revolution , we would like to these seeds poetry 萨满 Beijerinck 腊 by the rabbi . we &apos;ve created for all of this 社会分工 level 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society 三百年 only in history . 
in this brief history , I think there &apos;s enough for millennia , we have the ability to solve the challenges . 
and when we ask the meaning of life , different cultures , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different varieties of answers . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully aware of the species that we have to make sure that all those 昌盛 race , and all of life . 
I was in this picture was taken in northern 巴芬岛 at the top , and I was in some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 . this is a story to me about his grandfather &apos;s legendary story . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government isn &apos;t always do the Inuit , to build our sovereign we -- the to them . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
and his family to worry about security , and he took all weapons . 
you know , it &apos;s always the Inuit , and this is the advantage of it . 
sleds across the street , and that &apos;s the first of all wrapped up in North America caribou 鹿皮 of fish was freezing . 
this man doesn &apos;t fear the grandfather of the night and 凛冽 . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside of the skin . he &apos;s wearing his 长裤 to shit faster shit until fingers stiffen , he put it into blades . 
and in this shit on the edge of 口水 blades , and make it freezes it becomes very after that , after having to his dog &apos;ve dealt with it . 
and then peel off the 挽具 dog made out of his chest again a dog sleds and other animals that was not a dog that put it in a shit on the ice . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , the Aboriginal people all around the world of life 顽强 becomes real . 
April 1999 to Canada , than the size of the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was home , and we called it , and New Le dimensions . 
this is a separate , where they control of all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think for ever remote areas in the world who are actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids to the world is part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through a National Geographic and television is doing with things that we don &apos;t . 
we think and argue is not to convince others , but we think about the fact that we can get to the world , so we can change the world is probably the most at about a month and a click of the amount of three to five million 
we have a 156 channels in the country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . 
the Y arcas blaise aguera photosynth demos this stunning of this software , we can change the way to use digital images from the Internet , pick up a static photosynth stunning vision to create the kind of , and we can navigate . 
photosynth agueray arcas blaise . 
is that we see here . lots and lots and lots of bytes 千兆 gigabytes and level of our digital photographs , and they can continue to the full , by the way to look at them , and they could rearrange them . 
the data and see how much of the image , and there &apos;s a lot of images , seadragon themselves have this ability to deal with . 
most of these are pictures taken by a digital camera , but this is a picture of , it &apos;s a different from the scan images of the Library of Congress , 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the only things with our system , you know , just like a screen . seadragon 素数 is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;m going to show you that this is really a text , images , we can do this , you can see that it &apos;s really a rather text , images . 
maybe it would be a way to read the book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more practical , this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture starts did . 
the newspaper or a magazine , and it contains paper version of the scale , in reading , when you get better , readers experience , to enjoy the reading reading . 
here we are doing this in a small change issues in The Guardian on it . 
we fictional a high-resolution picture of the common -- that you see a lot of ads , high resolution of extra life into the picture . 
if you want to see the car , and you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way , to some extent of the actual use a screen . 
we can reduce the technology that would be playing out the window , and the kind of information . 
and of course , this map , number one is the obvious . 
so , I don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made their own . 
these are just geospatial NASA basis . 
do you get to the top of the road map . 
now , let &apos;s look at some of these , put down . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called the photosynth , it &apos;s actually two different kinds of technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other , graduate students at the University of Washington , is what snavely noah computer vision of the research and research . this is Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Rick szeliski Institute of Microsoft help . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
in this project has access to the Internet , it &apos;s based on technology seadragon building . 
you can see , we &apos;re going to have multiple ways to see pictures and images , going to have a more nuanced and at the resolution to experience . 
these images , but actually in the space is very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have more time to mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of sense of more than this space . 
because the website , we made a lot of respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by 串联 in this space . 
so , and then we go to easily . 
DH : be honest , I never thought I would come and work for Microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see from these images of the camera and a lot of different cell phone camera , and , in a single professional . so , the quality of different in all together in this environment . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , the picture of a touristy 大头 contains . , etc . , etc . 
I remember here -- I should have a series of photos , here . 
this is a poster Notre Dame in Paris . 
we can get to see the poster of the environment . 
this is the point here is that we can use the Internet community , effectively , we can start to get everyone to different data that everyone in the memory of the environment , collect together to build a model . 
and when all of these pictures are intertwined , to a much more than just take all of them . 
what this model is , however , the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like &quot; The Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth &apos;s long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and it becomes more valuable . 
by the users , went to tag on you . 
thank you very much . 
if I understanding you right now in the future is going to be a few years of the images from the 接合 together ? 
this is actually the software is to explore . 
it builds up with a link between . 
this 接合 is based on the content of the picture completely . 
the more exciting is that contains images of semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type of words , page after going to have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , with all these pictures , and you &apos;re going to be connected to this ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s great . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s incredible ! you congratulate . 
thank you very much . 
施瓦茨 choice in all the time . 
I want to talk about in this part of the book that I hope it , and what you &apos;ve heard with some of the things that you don &apos;t know what , if I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I think of a credo . 
tenets of what ? 
the West is not by 笃信 industrial society , a credo . 
the principles is to say that , if we allow people to get big benefits , the way it is to maximize to individual liberty . 
this is something that freedom is beautiful in itself , and the need for people . 
and once people have freedom , our own 做主 everybody can use all the way to get people to benefits , they don &apos;t 做主 for me . 
the freedom to that is a way to increase the biggest selective . 
people more choice is freedom , freedom , and more and more and more of it . 
I think , so that when you add it like this idea of our time in the age-old that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
and the same deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples look at the development of society , we become possible to do something . 
this is my . not one of the big supermarket . 
I just want to say ingredients salad here . 
you see , this is like a supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one stores configuration that includes a three-dimensional stereo system -- a CD , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , radio , an amplifier , 磁带机 . this one , a three-dimensional stereo system is the countless more . 
the components of it , you can have a combination of all in 3D 650万种 acoustic system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s a bunch of options . 
the telecommunications industry , let &apos;s switch gears . 
when I was a kid , you need telephone service to refer to that , and Maya that a company . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die . 
when the 一去不返 already . 
now I have almost infinite variety of cell phone , and that &apos;s it . &quot; 
these are the cell phone . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play and cutting hair , a French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
in your , if you haven &apos;t seen in the store , no , don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll see how . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , you have to ask : don &apos;t have a function of not so much ? 
the answer is , you want ? 
the answer is no ” “ . 
now , you can &apos;t buy one of the things that don &apos;t do so much more mobile phones . 
again , in some other lives more than a shopping thing for us , this effect on the explosion of choice . 
health care in the United States , right now -- is not at the doctor , who are you going to tell you how to do so time . 
contrary to the doctor , you know , they would say to you : we can use nail treatment 乙 , and you can use it . 
and so forth , and make a nail . risk . 
and so forth , and I have 乙 solution to a cure . you want to do ? 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
they said , &quot; I have these nail , again , risk , and make those 乙 with risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask your doctor : “ Doctor , to me , that you chose ” ? 
they said , but I don &apos;t “ ” you . 
now , that all the recipe for advertising , all these people around you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s not just to go . and since we buy counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , we looked at their ads would go in the morning after the doctor to call your doctor , on a prescription drugs , to put into them . 
now as our gender , all of this as a choice . like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender , business and inherit business from parents , it was invented by myself . 
so we can get back to shape their gender . 
it also means that you wake up every morning , you start to get what you want to do today is a guy who &apos;s and the woman to make a decision . 
in terms of family in marriage , everybody in the past . it &apos;s almost like age marriage , and then of course , is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
you need the choices , and who is not what it is , when I got married , and it &apos;s not going to do next . 
and now , all the things you can get to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach and some of the students are smart , but now I &apos;m going to give them less than ever before on the fifth assignment . 
it &apos;s not because they dumb than ever before -- of students , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so hardworking . 
now the reason is that they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself , what am I going to get married or not ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to a child , I knew , business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they &apos;re doing . I don &apos;t do it , whether they teach me what the class . 
they really should go to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technologies that we can , any time of day at work in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except hotel 夫 . 
but , in this restaurant , and you can have a place of WiFi , but I &apos;m not going to tell you what . 
why don &apos;t tell you I want to use . 
we say the incredible work that we have freedom of choice of choices that we need to make decisions , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about it . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 on the phone , and the other 裤兜 blackberry BlackBerry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we &apos;re looking at the same rivals for the kids , and ask yourself , and this is not the phone ? 
back to the email or not ? I don &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
if you give the answer is no child , you know , this is the experience of the game is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big stuff , is still a lifestyle choice , life is . 
and this is the world of life . 
I mean , there &apos;s nothing , but not to have a choice . 
and the world we live in today . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these choices , there &apos;s two people , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
one , some of it , paradoxically . it &apos;s not given us , but paralyzed , which is a box . 
people have found so many choices , very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , and this is a plan to invest in terms of his retirement income . 
one of my colleagues at the vanguard access to record . in a vanguard of a company that helps fund , has about a million people , and they 000多个 place . 
and when they found is that the client . and they want to give up a foundation of types of every 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than people down when you give 10 percent of the five foundations . why ? 
because facing 50种 to fund the option to choose to even more difficult it is that it just so you &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
a major tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you will never tomorrow . 
this is not a plan for a year , they make up from an employer 5千元 溜掉 手边 symmetrical . employer is going to provide the very dedicated . 
so , it &apos;s too much choice is numb . 
it allows us to the world , and that looks like this slide . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to be wrong , which helps fund or salad ingredients . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
and the more choices to inexplicably something to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not always satisfaction to make choices . 
secondly , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today about Daniel Gilbert . it &apos;s a enough , we see something depends on the value of that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you had to give you a choice . it makes you like to think of the chosen your 美中不足 . 
so , for example , that &apos;s not a cartoon , if you don &apos;t have anything in New York , I &apos;ll give you a 歉 . 
but that &apos;s what you want to be the right thing . 
see , these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have it . 
you can still better than that , right ? it &apos;s like they &apos;re really bad , huh , “ “ ” ” in August , is now . 
“ neighbors Manhattan ” at all . 
I &apos;m “ is to stop , and you can go back to my door ” . 
for two weeks , and he was tortured , this idea in 念叨 lost every day to the best of the parking . 
the opportunity cost “ ” we always have to make a decision to actually not even with a remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things , which is the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also have ” present “ . it &apos;s probably going to do step . 
but , of a truth is , when you choose to do something like , you have chosen not to do other things . 
often the other thing you have a place to decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
and once in a new way to buy my jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
so , a pattern jeans and come back , you don &apos;t buy pants , shit , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in the long enough to wash over time , after several times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , this is in the years old , I had to buy a new to the street . I said , &quot; I want to feed “ jeans , this is one of my ” size . 
and you &apos;re going to say , of the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
it &apos;s in front of his buttons . to pull the lockset is still ? 石磨 , the wash ? 
that grinds them going faster ? 
it &apos;s mouth , and the foot of Calvary about to say ? he 喋喋不休 . 
it &apos;s almost my chin . when I got over “ , I said to me , that &apos;s the only one was ” patterns . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , I took a I never had the most 合身 stores out the door . 
I don &apos;t really make that choice . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but you feel it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
and the reason I felt worse , because there is more than that , I can choose from a jeans is just how good and bad of a good . 
I was very low expectations . and then a jeans is too much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I had to go out and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expect more than that , and it becomes disappointing . 
in the lives of people together , in addition to that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of that other people don &apos;t know how many benefits . 
and that &apos;s just not so good about it , even though it &apos;s good . 
there &apos;s nobody to the market . because if you know that there are people who understand them , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what that means is that . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s coming all the bad things are better than now . 
and the reason is not a good things that people are likely to some amazing experience . 
we are now , in the industrialized , wealthy world of civic life &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you can only hope than you would expect it . 
what you &apos;ll never be surprised , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , which is you want to know here today , is this : the secret to happiness 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
I don &apos;t have this thing , I do 凑合 . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now in store for you , there are hundreds of blue jeans , you bought a choice , doesn &apos;t come back , and you ask , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer is : you . 
you can do better . 
on the right there , you have no excuse hundreds of jeans , make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even when the result of that , we decided to do is they &apos;re very good -- to blame myself , to be disappointed . 
in our generation of the industrialized world , in the developed world -- and explosive growth is clinically depressed . 
and finally , the net effect , even though the objective is better than we do , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this has recognized the choice of happiness , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no better than no choice , but not to do more choice is the picture . 
there &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ ’ we choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society is a choice , so many great things . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world that we , at least , we &apos;ve heard about a couple of problems , there &apos;s not too much . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic of modern Western societies on a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive car seats to operate 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated , it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
in fact , they gave us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us as before . 
this is what economists call 帕累 and improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of all of us , like a pandemic choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon in a wise man , and said , &quot; Huh “ of this fish , you know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
imagination , have had -- I first saw this painting that &apos;s when I read . 
but I want to be clear , surely know something about that fish . 
if you want to be honest , because they all become a fish , but don &apos;t , you get the freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible fish , but the , you reduce the happiness . 
you have increased is , is a paralyzed . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish . and for this fish , it &apos;s probably almost certainly for us , is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a symbolic suffering , it means to fish , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about these projects , and part of the human genome . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to the digital code in biology , a new design and synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life ” “ , I think , many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it down to the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve spent the last 20 years to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it &apos;s the world from analog in biology , computer analysis of September the digital world . 
we &apos;re trying to do now , if we can ask , or whether we went from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . for one , it &apos;s the smallest genome species in the lab to replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we &apos;re able to separate out from 500组 一百组 genes are in the front of us . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these synthetic chromosome is so part of it , we can change the fundamental to continue to ask the question . 
so we started to walk along the way that we can “ ? ” synthetic chromosomes . 
it allows us to chemical principles we never succeeded in making these molecules displayed ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way to live with , is just some of chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in an exponential rate of speed . 
the genetic code to write our progress very , very slowly , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
after the fact that we do for the first stage . in fact , the first trial conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out it &apos;s very difficult to synthesize DNA . 
in the world &apos;s 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA , 30 to 50 character in length , and this is a decline in the process , the more than that , the more wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to release these little fragments together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first Phi X 174 , from the phage genome and digital information . 
we use kill bacteria is a small virus . 
we created this genetic pieces , and it &apos;s wrong with , say , of a symbol of DNA . 
and the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live in the bacteria chemicals started reading the genetic code , bacteria , the virus particles . 
and then the cell to release the virus particles , and return to kill a different 兰氏 E. coli and negative fungus . 
and I was recently with some of the oil industry , and I think they understand this very well . 
and the more than you laughing out loud . 
so we think this is actually a software in biological systems to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer , and started using digital information to the digital information . 
in 1995 , when we first gene sequencing to this group of subjects , which is a fundamental mistake 10,000 . 
again , we found , in fact , the sequence is 30 . if we use this sequence the genome , you might not be forever . 
part of the design of 50 is not far from the &apos; 50s and many other than the symbol of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
we &apos;re designing one of the unique . 
you may have heard about 水印 in one of us . 
you see the genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
and these scripts 三联 -- and the way these scripts like about 20 amino acids amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , we &apos;re doing is working with it . 
we don &apos;t have a little disappointed -- some people to do with a poem . 
and we can use these fragments bias enzyme . there &apos;s enzyme , to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time getting out and fragmented , and at a time . 
each of us on the stage , so that they can give them , because we want to create a very reliable process , you will see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep in E. coil longer in trying to do in the modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred recombinations to repair in biology , it &apos;s a piece of DNA , put them together . 
here &apos;s an example of a microbes 球菌 called resistant to be able to withstand 三百万度 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , it to the back together again , before . 
we can do it , there are thousands of microbes . 
out of water to these microbes . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there I met a new , the water . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a molecule that we made these microscopic images , it &apos;s yeast mentioned in the way through , and we put the pieces of design , essentially , to make them automatically yeast . 
this is not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
it &apos;s such a big molecule optics microscope , we can take a look at it . 
these are the 六秒 about it . 
this is what we open up the recent experiment . 
this is a far more genetic code 580000 . this is not by humans setting the structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font print it out , you need to print 142页 . and the genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously a very simple dealing with a bacteria , viruses are much more complicated . 
so as we do that ourselves as a relatively simple , and you can take the cells into another , this is what you hear about cloned . 
and for the bacteria , 连成 chromosome one with the cells , but recently , we also know that we can do a whole transplanting cells chromosome from one to another to activate the cells . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process , but that &apos;s what we &apos;re trying to turn it into a better design process . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species , or the third place in a second , thousands of features to add a new its own . 
people who were in the process of evolution of the time , there will be just a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit digesting the DNA is enzyme . 
the chromosome out of that cells don &apos;t have this enzyme enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it &apos;s identity , and that &apos;s a chromosome out of the matter , it &apos;s going to it , and finally , we have to have a new DNA . 
we put it into a gene causing the blue . 
in a very short period of time , all of the characteristics of all species that were disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put on the new software “ ” cells . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , and in fact , it is that we will implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we do , through DNA to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do that ? 
I think some of the reasons why we need to do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now , in the world in three people from 1946 , each one of us ; there in the next 40 years , in four . 
we provide the food for 65亿 , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s going to 捉襟见肘 nine billion people . 
we use , rather than the 300多亿桶 50亿顿 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace or whatever , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that all of this material in the atmosphere of CO2 emissions . 
and we found from around the world in a database of about 两千万组 genes , and I like to call them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
we have now from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make mixtures of what we call the ” “ the synthesis of fast . 
we now have the ability to build a robot that we can make a chromosome . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can choose , the ability to survive , or chemical production , the production of fuel , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the whole thing is that some of the work that we actually sit in the computer to design species actually use software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like them . we know exactly what is the genetic code . 
we focus on the ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you saw recently into corn ethanol is going to be a bad . 
soon we will have a second and third is sugar . into higher value for the fuel or different types of 丁醇 辛烷 . 
and we think we &apos;re going to get 18 months first 第四代 fuel . 
and the CO2 is the way -- one . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , methane , carbon dioxide molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we can see in their collection , these two very convenient , they can be introduced into , with fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can increase the life ? &quot; &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we did with the whole oil industry , with a little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where you have to be a major ? pollution-free . 
and we &apos;re using the same instant made out of the tools . 
you see this all the flu , we &apos;re going to slow down at the time of year , and lack of money , when the vaccine useful . 
I think it can be a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation , accompanied by evolutionary tree , as a species of bacteria , nuclear is really have such an artifact for the biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a far away and improve human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough to do that , maybe . thank you very much . 
in this short 09年 estimated at TED , Brian Cox Collider shares some of which are now , the news . and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : what the LHC out ? 
over the last TED introduced me to speak to the LHC . 
and I said , &quot; because it back to talk to you in the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
the universe in reinventing the billionth of a second per second , and began to create a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the ground in Geneva 
and we used these little changes to the Big Bang . 
this is my work on , ATLAS . the inaugural detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the small number of particles , as we all around the LHC along with the LHC is a part of the particles in the heat 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September , we know that this machine that would work . it &apos;s a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know is that this is a 满堂喝彩 -- when people and to see if this is an icon Google . 
this suggests that we work with this culture has its impact on the science of significant . 
but about a week later , we came up with some of the machine , with these 导线 导线 -- the gold . 
and then they conduction 导线 all 安培 when the machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do it , because when it &apos;s a very low superconducting 导线 . 
so in the middle of the planet than 271摄氏度 below the temperature of the universe is so strong that can conduction 导线 electricity . 
in at the LHC 接点 电磁铁 九千多个 on a technology to install a mistake . 
so 导线 to rise , it &apos;s a little bit more of a sudden , the transmission is 安培 resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
that was pretty shocking , because they move material you hear about a mile constructed . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
they &apos;ve got to work , they unloaded has done . 
we give them , it out . 
now , back waiting for them . 
so in the back of the three refer to be the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to start it , and in six to data , and when we find out the mission of the most basic units . 
now obviously , and so one of these accidents to a cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still want projects , and that &apos;s where the value of the LHC . 
thank you . 
呵护 . Elizabeth Gilbert talk for creativity and to reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event , despite the recent work in my life in a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
now , it turns out to people , and I think this is the result is that life , and no matter where I think , this is my life . 
so , really , really , saved , 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very worried and said to me , you don &apos;t afraid of “ ? not beyond all of you don &apos;t have that book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you will never be afraid not work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid to continue to collapse on you ? 
and you end up in the broken , died in despair at the center of failure , and I was always get question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , it &apos;s all these people are scared , until today . 
yes , it &apos;s all these people are scared , until today . 
except , in fact , I &apos;m afraid that many people think of it , except that I was afraid to a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear ? but , writing and writing , I was thinking , writing , why would I fear ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people are afraid of doing your job ? and destined ? people afraid logical destined for their logical ? it work ? 
nobody said work “ meet John , chemistry ? bottlenecks ” ? 
it could never ask . 
of course , this chemical engineers 平心而论 groups , not in the last few centuries , drunk and depressed and 享誉 狂躁 addiction , not in the past few centuries , drunk and depressed and 享誉 狂躁 addiction , around the world . 
just a century to see in the early creative genius , the great examples are just 英年早逝 century looked in the early creative genius , are great examples of 英年早逝 died before is often . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t even out their talent , no suicide , who don &apos;t often reveal talent . 
in the front , 曼梅 died in the last time I said , &quot; “ every book 蚕食 ” part of me . 
and for your work life , it &apos;s such a radical . 
in this room today I want to ask you , there &apos;s no exceptions to that ? I &apos;m going to ask is , in the room that you are not exceptions , right ? 
the idea that you had a problem ? even further away at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of the outside in 
and that &apos;s not only 可憎 , I don &apos;t want to have this idea that the next century . 
and that &apos;s not only 可憎 , I don &apos;t want to have this idea that the next century , and it &apos;s not terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want to have this idea that the next century . 
I think that encourages us great geniuses of going to live better . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I believed that is due to me , especially in the dark in my career stage right now , especially in my career . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you know , I was young , I was 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years career . 
well , frankly , we &apos;re all in this talk is , I would say , a friend , and the heart , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of ideas . 
is this idea , which is on a 大清早 -- not to have a way , is this idea , which is on a 大清早 drinking wine on the road -- I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to go into that I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
and I think , as it down to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protection . 
in some way , I need to build a safe distance themselves from , and I write a piece of the responses from the writing anxious , and I had the response . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go back to the problem . 
and that in Ancient Greece Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from humans and ancient Rome in ancient Greek , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from humans and ancient Rome in ancient Greek , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred from distant and unknowable 精灵 to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable purpose and unknowable from remote places , to be an artist with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called in common with this kind of creative stewards for “ 精灵 ” for 
when people think that general -- Socrates , a stewards for that gives him from a distance that general wisdom , and there &apos;s a -- Socrates stewards for that gives him , from a distance . 
people have similar to the point of view , they put this kind of creative genius called “ ” 精灵 ancient Rome , people who have similar to what kind of invisible innovation 精灵 ” “ genius 
this is a wonderful , because people don &apos;t think “ Rome ” genius is a particularly intelligent wonderful this view of Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is amazing , this is that I was looking for is to make this safe distance from people who work on protecting the 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand how it , isn &apos;t it ? 
by this ancient artists , and get protection of the ancient artist narcissism by this idea , and get protection narcissistic too . 
if you work great , it can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of “ ” genius of the project . 
if you look at the very worst of all , you don &apos;t know . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you &apos;re really bad “ ” genius 
this is the Westerners in looking for a long time of creativity . 
and I &apos;m going to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes , which is the swallow one-nth of vulnerability , it &apos;s too big . 
this was completely straight up twisted , one of the self and for people to make it . it was completely distorted of one person to person , and this was done . 
I think that &apos;s the kind of stress , you get in the last 500 years , I think , so this is an artist stress , you get in the last 500 years of artists . 
and I think this is really , at least that &apos;s the question is : what we do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : how do we do ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go to a reference to the old for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to a reference to the old for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a went off , 18 developed 500多年 question-asking in the human mind , the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking in the developed 500多年 rationality . 
maybe I could convince you agree with me . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any of you who &apos;ve tried to make sure you all sitting there going through this process doesn &apos;t always know rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
on the Mall , like this , and the outpouring of her face . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
so , here &apos;s the only thing to do with her , one thing is , say , really “ ” dashed across 
in some other time , this is the part of my other : the name , and this is part of me sometimes , and she said to her poem 错过 almost . 
and she would take the other hand , it &apos;s a poem by the tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , in the paper 誊写 poetry 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the beginning of the word , to go after the first words . 
I heard her story : it &apos;s incredible , like this , the creative process , and I , of course , it &apos;s not me ! -- all of the creative process , I don &apos;t work , and so much more like the way . 
but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get the idea of an accident , but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get the idea of an accident . 
maybe there &apos;s something like a lot of people . 
if you think , 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , and if you think , 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on here ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it will not rational , loss ? we &apos;re going to see how it will not rational , loss ? 
he was going to capture it , but there is no way , his pen and paper , you don &apos;t have a tape recorder , and he was going to capture it , but there &apos;s no way of , he didn &apos;t have a tape .

since that happened , you change the creative process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , he still is completely dark . 
and he could be inspired by creating a bizarre between the unknown and weird , wonderful relationship with his creative inspiration , and this is the unknown between the strange , bizarre , wonderful , which is a partnership for life outside itself .

not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I think I should go to write this book . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I think I should go to write this book . 
and then I remembered , shouting and Tom for the day , and I tried to Tom reminds me of the day , shouting to that , and then I tried to . 
I looked up from the manuscript , an empty room to me from the manuscript to hold it erect , one of the room .

if you want “ this book is better , and some of them , you turn that part of your ” work . 
if you don &apos;t “ , you can see that the ” . &quot;

the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer and the professional performing a wonderful , because they are a great dancer . 
occasionally , although very much indeed , but something will happen to be a dancer 出世 beyond the transcendent . 
you know what I say this , because you &apos;ve all seen in that moment , somewhere . 
it was time to stop the dancer , it seems to be stopped across time as a dancer , the movement and what he did not show the different 1000场 , but all of these amazingly , it is .

he impressed is not a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , from the bottom of the light and shine by sacred fire . 
clearly , people know what it is , they can call it , and the name of this is exactly what it is , they name .

in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of : all are cheering you on your way to Alabama “ 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , really , really great , great , that &apos;s incredible miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
the tricky for artists in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 to wake up , around the artist &apos;s 悠悠 dancer and the next morning , wake up to 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning is that , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and that &apos;s just a bad leg , when the old people are going to go for it , and he just couldn &apos;t get the height of that . 
maybe we will not dance to people in his all are cheering you on your way miracles are going to do with him ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of self , understanding the pain . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of self , understanding the pain , this is a very tricky issues , which is the creative process of self , understanding the pain . 
but maybe we don &apos;t have been so painful , if you were never thought that was starting from your art , if you were never thought that was starting from your art . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , you need to do good work ” that part . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , you need to do good work ” that part . 
and you hold the jobs jobs , whether you : if you are , what is that the dancers . 
and you hold the jobs jobs , whether you : if you are , what is that the dancers . 
that is , if you don &apos;t keep jobs , hold your dance , and I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
that is , if you don &apos;t keep jobs , hold your dance , and I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
嘞 you ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists that the prediction is worth more than that , and that for his ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently : in the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of South America by the 48 state reducing 40 percent . 
but this is not because it &apos;s not a question of that one out of ice cap . 
it &apos;s the polar ice cap , like the beating heart of the climate system . 
the winter and summer actually hyperextending heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you in a piece of the last 25 years . 
the ice is permanent was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s a year in the dark blue is this ice formed in the context of the Year in summer , ice was freezing . 
what was freezing “ ” context , it &apos;s about five or more time , and you can see the ice , and it &apos;s like the body to 各部 guy . 
at that time , 25 years , from here to here . 
that is worthy of the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there is a letter was freezing 干冰 defrost -- carbon and clean from microbes , methane , carbon . 
if you just a little bit of greenhouse gas emissions , which is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska , you can see in the lake has been a went out . 
the last winter , at the professor walter alaska 结队 katey light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s OK , what do we do ? 
this is a reason , the heat of heat Greenland . 
the last year , this is a river . 
but 往年 than traffic . 
this is a river kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising and the mouth of the Nung is it . 
here is a dramatic rise in traffic . 
the other side , the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
and in the West Antarctica below sea level of that are accelerating the melting . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest ice in himalayas at the top , you can see new lakes , and it &apos;s just a few years ago , ice . 
being from the world to 40 percent of the water . 
in the Andes , it is the city of ice drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry dramatically increase the numbers . 
and that is the number of absolute disaster in the kind of the increase in speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of 七十五年 four times more early . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
we &apos;re in the past five years to increase the CO2 emissions 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 carbon dioxide . 
watch the Americas ; the Pacific region in India to the west , from the time dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
because the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
the oil , coal urgent is very important . 
the world &apos;s largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution had to use is to build a planet , carbon -- coal and more . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what &apos;s new and some of the green alternative . 
so , but it &apos;s a political in our country . 
the oil and coal in carbon , and spent the last year to promote clean coal 两千五百万美元 that &apos;s a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what reminded me . 
and before Christmas , Tennessee in my hometown of digging muck billions of coal . 
you probably saw on the news 
the second largest here , put the water . 
before Christmas , in this happen . 
there are one carbon -- coal and advertising . 
and the coal cool is happy and happiness . 
you can see in the United States , more productive , and he also help us about the economic development . 
and the coal cool every day to become more healthy . 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a virginia west , where the coal . 
there &apos;s the head of the coal mining massey 
so , climate protection is that people of one of the current , and we launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of coal mining and define what the truth . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , well , it &apos;s clean the smell . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about global warming and 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at the art and clean coal plants . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but this is the sound of clean coal technology . 
to burn coal , though , is the main reason for global warming , here you see one of the technology that fascinated clean coal , who changed everything . 
let &apos;s look today . this is a clean coal technology . 
this is a can handle the national security and economic challenge . 
in the United States national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis . 
all these crisis strings together is based on carbon , for instance , the dirty oil product import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
america repower with using 100 percent of the decade of clean electricity . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and in the global warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve our problems . 
to understand more america repower . 
the final 
this is about america repower . 
in the old oil and dirty murder our planet , it &apos;s dependent on it , we reduce the fastest way . 
in the wind and solar power . here , a new network of energy . 
investment to create a new kind of work . 
has america repower . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far and fast . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables to show -- a toy . 
first of all , I want you to think about when you have plenty of playing with Legos . 
and when you how to build the and go out the hands-on , and you &apos;re learning how to solve problems . this is the object is to understand and 空间结构 . 
what really helps us 空间结构 objects around for a lot of learning things . 
some of the questions that are sitting in my mind , so we decided to find the answers , so it &apos;s siftables . 
simply said , &quot; is a siftable interacting with computers , it &apos;s like the crackers . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 can siftable , each other , the perception and siftable 每块 monitor and radio device . 
and most importantly , it &apos;s siftable 每块 , like , can block . 
and it represents a new siftables ecosystems -- the tools of digital information . 
with independence , more tools that are more sensitive to each other , with all its senses , mobile , so we can use this tool , and try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show some simple . 
they &apos;re typing are siftable it like this , if I put it to the side of that , so it &apos;s all in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images , in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they are a resounding 挨 , one of the interesting things happen . 
if you have a bunch of them , they will have noticed , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other , and it senses . 
we found an interesting interaction through some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like that , for example , the colors down to one another , you pour it from a siftable siftable . 
let &apos;s look at this , there are three sets of patterns to paint barrel siftables , we can put it into the water in the middle of the color , together with color . 
and again , it can go back . 
siftables machine learning , and you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to learn from these functions , on-the-spot faster to see the results . 
this is my show siftables here -- and the reason is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
these words siftables can play a game -- and boggle scrabble remix of games . 
in this together as a game , you just take a piece of a letter siftable with dollars , when you put together siftables letters of the words in the dictionary , the siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later automatically siftables spell on the right word that change the sequence of words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
now , so it &apos;s screen in the Media Lab some children are involved in the siftables experience , I &apos;m going to test the experience of the kids in the process . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and what &apos;s interesting is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
he &apos;s going to just say a word , this is a “ ” together , they know what to do . 
now the screen on other people &apos;s siftables experience . 
this is the right-hand corner of the ages . 
he just wanted to siftables stack together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now is a screen function interact with it . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is the child Felix . 
he could use some new graphics to add elements , what he did on the table siftables is to pick up some graphics video toward a new , and you can add elements to this animation . 
the Sun , and he put it together . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David tractors add up to him . 
in orange . 
well done . 
in siftables to shake graphics can make a new element in his picture to add up to a new element 吠 -- dogs . 
he was writing a story of his animation . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plans , his story . 
fly away , sitting in a cat . 
I &apos;m going to show you one last demonstration , even in this feature is playing music , siftables recently we &apos;ve developed in the function of sounds like a note , and 超载 , and the sound of drums . 
and there were 任君 四档 modulation , that choice . 
you can think of the sound of the modules into edit siftable tiles on the way you like siftable . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles tiles . 
there &apos;s kind of sound filter , which is a 响器 siftable of tiles . 
the sound of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles . 
and then , you can use to control the tiles rhythm and volume edited siftable siftable to adjust the tiles rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
it started to get two editors 超载 note , and then add some 超载 tiles . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to put sound filter Drums tiles , and you can adjust tiles . 
I &apos;m going to need to accelerate the pace of tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to turn to the filter sound filter tiles tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can do . 
so don &apos;t even starting to play , but in a long time , but it &apos;s a short fight straightforward adaptation . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with a volume , the editor tiles tiles on the left , to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was to develop a new medium for computer-human interaction with the brain , the better . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you that we thought that was developed by a new generation of technology -- and the digital media 接轨 technology to bring , it &apos;s going to change the world of innovation that we &apos;re going to see this generation . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
