rapture photos and stories through for National Geographic , the explorers by Wade Davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary culture indigenous people around the world , that &apos;s an alarming rate , from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born in the world and 母腹 生儿育女 
we &apos;re going to experience of adult would 
you have to deal with the brutal 生离死别 and so we &apos;re going to sing and dance in 排遣 苦楚 of life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find that every culture songs rhythm and dance with the rhythm of unique . 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you send will now be thinking that you see hope . 
the world of cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by a mental life and culture life of the Earth to cover the whole network of the Earth , it &apos;s a very important 芸芸众生 , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the web 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , as we have a strong at the species . 
as the biosphere of race and the same with the same , the destruction of the end , and it faster . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 language 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s all of the spirit of the unique culture in this substance 承 carriers of the world . 
every one of the mind is a language , and a mental ecosystem accumulate and precipitation long-term . 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that and we all in the same number of language , there &apos;s no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that the act , unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and . 
another one of the Earth is in fact , about every two weeks , you will have to be a 仙逝 with an ancient is the language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore the race , and let you in a circle , race , and you come in to lose civilization . 
there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I said “ ” in front of the survival of the different ways , and I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 pull the Arabic in 蚺 that they &apos;re called the race because they believe in a time that they 米尔克 coming from the of the sacred about snakes . 
the groups of people can &apos;t tell the difference between the green and blue because of their 栖身 天穹 their so in the forest canopy , and no difference . 
they said , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 异族 通婚 called went to the people with a different kind of language , married people . 
this is based on through the history of the mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language , there &apos;s a very often , you never see 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador race to the most amazing 华拉尼 is one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five years to missionary 1957 to these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they from eight to leave the air , they have 十张 . we think this is kind of , but they don &apos;t think about these people who live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil . and they use 戮 with this missionary five . 
more of that is not only 华拉尼 戮 external die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
we found only to investigate 宗谱 一个八代 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the old people . the wood is going to do , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have the 惊诧 revealed . 
they can unsporting characters , a 40 to smell urine 开外 animals , and they know what that is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand the way I have to figure out that the magic of religion voodoo taught how to teach voodoo is the magic of a dark . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the most important in the world will give you the example of religion . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about it is living with a connection between them . 
in living soul . 
the rhythm of the dance can tap 大水 to replace &apos;s soul of the soul of the living in that moment for 侍僧成 flash of light . 
so , voodoo who like to say , you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
I have all of life in the north of Columbia in the mountains of 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
and this is the ancient tyranny civilization , they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of isolated in a plain . 
in this bloody ethnic this continent globe has never been to the people . 
and today , they will monk 续 along with the system , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monk . 
they like to go back to the 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain is these values , and the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call themselves for lies , we call for over , we are in the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
it &apos;s not going to indigenous 多愁善感 思乡 would not suffer the torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain of God , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship between people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be the deforestation . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this is a picture of me last year in August in Northwest Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent the color of the dopamine , and in the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
the rice 亚诺马 from people with serotonin , plants extract the nose and continuing . 
if you take a , you can see the powder in these hallucinations , these wacky , in a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s in front of you are not distorted 荡然无存 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
these oral substance dopamine color , to have to change oral 氧化酶 dopamine , and one of the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in 藤本植物 咔 啉 β -- there was going to be able to control 氧化酶 dopamine , and to power of the color , so you ask yourself , everyone must 
we , ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask the Indian people will say they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people die in the cane is all in the deep jungle , they found that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to have some plants . 
you don &apos;t know the plants , and I said , is not 
and I tell you , if they said in the months circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , even though we some of the indigenous people think that they confront compassion 离群索居 enrich lives of the world forward , but as we develop these people in the back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians , even though it &apos;s still with the Great Sioux Nation Indians and ride to the United States , and it &apos;s still life , the people in the United States . 
the threat of intact and race is not change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we look at in Tibet recently , where I do a lot of research , where you can see some of the authoritarian political . 
and by the genocide in the same race , culture , but denounce . it &apos;s way of life , people destruction of the crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of the praise by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with 
and this young man 班禅 喇嘛 皈依 father . 
he immediately after the Chinese people were killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together to Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
there &apos;s only two years old , and he and his mother , his quietly in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister behavior , and just by the 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of 臂章 and being a nation of 劳教 for seven years . 
the pain of Tibet for people to take the human redemption to get to see . 
and we &apos;re going to have a choice , we want to live in a single in the world is also need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve drained 60 . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
新石器 revolution of the human into the seeds of agriculture , we would 腊 萨满 &apos;s poetry is the rabbi . we create a level of all of this 社会分工 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society will only last 三百年 history . 
I think this brief history , and we have the ability to make a solution to the future of the face of challenge . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully to the species that we have to make sure that all the race , and all of life 昌盛 prosperity . 
I was in this picture was taken up in the northern part of the 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family , and he worried about the safety of all the weapons , and he took tools . 
you know , the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the advantage of the day , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear of the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside in the skin . he 长裤 to shit faster shit until fingers stiffen , he put it into the shape of the blades 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 after freezes it becomes very robust , and then he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
off the skin dog made out of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds condoms to make a dog . don &apos;t was that the manure of in on the knife . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 life becomes real . 
1999 four months of government to Canada , than the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was a new home , it &apos;s the name of the New Le dimensions , 
this is a independent of where they control all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country , can make a difference to fix it , and the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think that used to go to the rural areas of the world people actually not remote . 
because there is a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination , you can go back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids to the world is part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about the fact that you can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on a website of thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . thank you . 
blaise aguera Y arcas . in this stunning photosynth demo , the software that could change the way we watch digital images from the . pick out the static photosynth created stunning photos , the dream , and you can , and one of them . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
we see here is the 千兆 and gigabits lots and lots and lots of bytes . at a digital photograph , they can continue to zoom in , and the full by the way to look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
no matter how many of the data , see images , and how much of the images , seadragon all have this ability to deal with . 
so most of the picture is taken by a digital camera , but this is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the Library of Congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just , you can use 素数 . seadragon like of the screen , and it &apos;s a very , very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;m going to show you that this is really text , images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more , and this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a did , starts . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself is the ratio of images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we do a little change in The Guardian issues that to the corner . 
we fiction a high-resolution picture of the common -- that you see the normal high resolution of advertising , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way , to actually avoid the use of the screen . 
we hope that this technology can reduce the cause of unnecessary play out the window , and the kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , digital maps is so obvious , and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
on top of the United States , and with the road map . 
now , we put these , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go to experience . 
this project called photosynth , it &apos;s actually kind of technology : two . 
one is seadragon , and the other , from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely computer vision of what the research . this research seitz Steve Washington University . 
and Microsoft Institute of szeliski Rick . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
in this project on the Internet has a seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way to look at pictures , and to do much more nuanced and have at the resolution to experience . 
these images , but in the space is actually a very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of the more interesting than this space . 
because the website , we made a lot of respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
by this , it was really happy . 
I think you can see that these images from the camera , a lot of different cell phone camera , from a single professional to the . so a lot of different quality , in all together in this environment . 
I want to find some more weird . 
see , a lot of pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here , there should be a sequence of images -- ah , in here . 
this is the poster Notre Dame in Paris . 
we can get to the poster , to see the whole of the environment . 
the point here is that we can work with the community . we can get everyone to different data to collect the memory of the environment , together , to build a model . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all . 
this model , however , what is the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like , &quot; The Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , you will be on in . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right , you &apos;ll be able to this software , in the next few years to come from the picture of the global 接合 together ? 
. this is actually the software is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this is the process of 接合 based on the content of the picture . 
the more exciting is that a lot of the pictures semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type , on the web to have a lot of with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , the image with you ? 
at that time , so these semantic information in each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s incredible ! you congratulate . 
thank you very much . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
and I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to from a of principles . 
what kind of principles ? 
that &apos;s the Western industrial society , not by 笃信 a credo . 
the principles that is to say , if we want to get people to make the welfare of , the way is to maximize to individual liberty . 
the reason is free , and this is a wonderful , to value , for people . 
and once people have freedom , we can use 做主 all the way to get the benefits , people don &apos;t have to for 做主 . 
the freedom to be a way that &apos;s the selectivity of . 
the choice of the people , more free , the more and more freedom , the more that welfare state . 
I think , this idea that we , like so that when you add it into a deep-seated presumption that in the water that people didn &apos;t want to ask questions about it . 
and the same deep embedded in our daily lives . 
I &apos;m going to give you some examples of contemporary look at the progress of social development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say the salad ingredients . 
you see , this is the supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional sound system -- speaker , a CD , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional stereo system is a lot more . 
with this store , you can components out of 650万种 close together with the three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and that is to go to companies , and Maya that only a . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually died at the phone , it &apos;s not all bad . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
now I &apos;m almost infinite variety of the phone , and that &apos;s the mobile phone . . 
these are the future of the cell phone . 
and I love most in the middle -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , a French and cut hair forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store seen , don &apos;t have to worry about , not how you would see . 
this is the result of that , people went to the store , you have to ask : don &apos;t have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in some other life in more than shopping for us , and the effect of the Big Bang . 
the health care -- not in the United States , right now is that you go to the doctor , who do so , how do you tell the time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment nail , can also use 乙 . 
there &apos;s a very nail . and so forth and risk . 
and so forth , and I have a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , how do I do ” ? 
they said , again , these are nail 乙 risk , and I have the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you have to me , that you chose ” ? 
doctor : “ , but I don &apos;t you ” . 
now the recipe , all the ad is for you and I of the ordinary people . and if you think about it . just say , if we can &apos;t just counter to buy . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call the doctor , on a prescription drugs in them . 
now , we like the gender of the identity of this thing into a choice . it &apos;s like trying to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we can to shape of their gender . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of men and women are the decision . 
in the marriage of family , everyone in the past age is to take for granted that is almost got married , and then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart and good students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , one of the fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they students than ever before . stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself , what am I going to get married or not ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to the kids , and I knew things ? 
this is the problem of 脑筋 . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they do not do I work , whether they in my class to take a grades . 
they should go to these problems , because this is something important question . 
now do work , like Carl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can in one day , any time of any of the Earth in a corner -- and of course , this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , there &apos;s a place of wireless can go online , but I &apos;m not going to tell you what . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
and we work with these incredible that we have freedom of choice is the choices we had to make decisions , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 BlackBerry and with the blackberry lap , and with the laptops . 
even if they closed , we are looking at the same rivals for the kids , and ask yourself , this is not the phone ? 
back to or not ? I don &apos;t have this email to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is not the kids , you know , this is the experience of the game is big compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big of matter , it &apos;s way of life , life is . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still , but nothing is not to have choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know , it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these choices , there &apos;s two people , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
one , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we have . it &apos;s not , but inside , is paralysis . 
with so many choices that people want to make a decision is very , very difficult . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan to invest in his retirement income , and do it . 
one of my colleagues had access to record . in the vanguard vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office . 
and she found is that when the customers and their employees to provide the support of fund . every increase the 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 people than you down for five , 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it is even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow , Tomorrow &apos;s graph , and , of course , you will never tomorrow . 
not to this plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so many possibilities , choice is the result of paralysis . 
it makes us into the world looks like this , and this slide . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose a wrong fund , or salad ingredients . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices to , for some strange thing to feel regret . this is one , it &apos;s not happy with their own choice . 
and second , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert about a enough , we see is a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you give up the choice of the ways that you always . this is the one you think that 美中不足 . 
so an example of that . and if you don &apos;t , New York , I said , a 歉 
but this is what you want to be right now . 
look at this two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it can be better than this ? this point in to “ huh , really , bad ” “ ” , in August , is now . 
“ Manhattan neighbors don &apos;t ” at home . 
I &apos;m going to “ is to stop that can go back to my door ” . 
two weeks , and he was a idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the parking . 
“ ” opportunity cost , we always have to make decisions , even with enough to actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things , all the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it &apos;s also said the “ present ” . it &apos;s probably going to do step . 
one of them , but it is , when you choose to do something to it , you don &apos;t do it . 
these are the things that it attracted a lot of you decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I have to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last jeans , that &apos;s a pattern , you buy , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to washed so many times , pants get 凑合 . 
so , that many , many years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new . I said , I want to feed “ a jeans , this is the size of the ” . 
and the : are you going to say , the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 , or the wash ? 
to quickly that grinds them ? 
and back , and the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw , almost off . and I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to that is used to be the only ” a pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a I never have the most 合身 pants out the door . 
I don &apos;t really have to do . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it , and I specifically wrote a book for my own make excuses . 
I felt worse , the reason is , because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a jeans , what &apos;s good to be a good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least the economy is a perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I got I had to go and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in the lives of people together , except for things that can improve people &apos;s expectations of how good to bring people outside , and how many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
the market do not know the truth . because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this in it , in all the bad things are better than now . 
the reason is , when one of the things that are not good people could experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , industrial of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
you will never be what surprises , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
this thing , I didn &apos;t 凑合 , what I &apos;m trying to do . 
but can 凑合 is not necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are in store for you in hundreds of jeans , you buy a back , don &apos;t happy , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
and out there on the jeans hundreds of excuses , you don &apos;t make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good -- to be disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and the clinical explosive growth is depressed . 
and finally , the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this brought to the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice no choice , but can &apos;t predictions are that the more choices . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ ’ we choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now , let &apos;s talk about a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many of the matter is , a rich . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world that we , at least , we &apos;ve heard about a few of them , there &apos;s no problem , too . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this is the modern Western societies of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seat 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not from ago . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of us , like the plague of choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position of intelligence , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
to tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting , it is . 
but , I want to feel this fish , the more clearly , what we know for sure . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is , is the paralyzed . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish . so , for this fish , it &apos;s possible for us , almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish and that means to be suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects about the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
this time , we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code in biology , to a new design , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” , I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists to try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now we have almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from the biology of September the analysis of the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s for a genome of the species in the lab to replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we have to separate out the 500组 一百组 is that we these . 
so , we can continue to think that the only way is to study these synthetic chromosome so we can change its part of the most fundamental to continue to ask the question . 
and so we started to walk along this path , we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principles really allowed us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life in an exponential rate and speed . 
we write the genetic code , the ability to progress very slowly , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago , we started this work . 
in fact , it was for the first stage . we do in the first time , the biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline of the process , the more than that , the more it wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first , from Phi X 174 genome phage , and the digital information . 
is a small kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
the other stages of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually the software in a biological system , to build the hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that these numbers to information . 
when we in the first time in gene sequencing to this group of subjects , every 10,000 is a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to 30 , the average is wrong . and if we use this sequence , the genes can never be . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the other 50 symbol of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
we have one of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments bias enzyme . some of the enzyme , to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to make 24 and character of length of time and time getting out , and at a time . 
at every stage , we had a lot of culture that sequence , so we can give them , because we want to create a very reliable . you &apos;re going to see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve the level of the automated 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep the coil . in a long , long . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair the DNA , it can put together than 
here &apos;s an example of a tolerance called microbes 球菌 radiation to be able to withstand 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it in all of the chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , the before . 
we can have this , there are thousands of microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and life there , there &apos;s a new environment , the water . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule microscopic . through this process , which is what the yeast , and the way , and we put it into the design of the right . they talk to automatically yeast . 
this is not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just a regular optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than 580000 character of genetic code . this is set by humans and structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s more than 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font to print it out . and you need to 142页 to print the genetic code 
how do we get to a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple , with a bacteria is much more complicated . 
so we like to deal with that and relatively simple , and then you can take a nucleus sitting in a different cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , the chromosomes 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell cells to another and activate it . 
the new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this just that . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species , or the third place in the chromosomes , within seconds the thousands and thousands of new features to it . 
what of the people in the process of evolution , every time a gene that &apos;s the idea of change , are actually a lot of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes , is to be able to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of cells , and no , no , this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
that &apos;s it , and recognize the other &apos;s chromosomes , it &apos;s to digest , and finally , we have a have new DNA . 
we put in the gene that causes it became blue . 
in a very short period of time , all of the characteristics of the species that were all gone , and completely into a new species , we put on the cell ” “ new software . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is that we actually implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged out of this digital based on the design of the new species . 
why do that ? 
I think some of the reason why we need to do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from the 65亿 into nine billion 
in my own , and I was born in 1946 . 
now in the world &apos;s three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , in four . 
we provide 65亿 for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people to change 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature that can replace or any of it , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now have found from around the world in a database of 两千万组 about genes , and I like to see them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because these can make what we call the mixing “ ” group of very synthetic . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can live in , the ability to fuel or chemical production , the production and so on . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that we actually sit in the computer work really use software to design the design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code , they look like . 
we focus on the ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide is one of the way -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other way . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to collect their , they &apos;re very convenient , then it can be introduced into , with fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic problem . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry , the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there ? to be a major . 
and we also use the same tools out in the vaccine . 
you can all of this flu , we &apos;re always going on in time and a year , the lack of money , when the vaccine . 
I think this is a vaccine was can make change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last , and that is accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a far more and more human life to improve the way . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do that . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox shares some which super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
in the last year at TED , I speak at the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to the machine is because it is . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the ground in Geneva 
we use to the Big Bang , some little 
this is the period I work on , ATLAS . detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles along the way , as we all around the LHC plan with the LHC , in part of a lot of particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know , this is a 满堂喝彩 is this -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with the culture that on the shock of it . 
but about a week later , we machine out of a major with these 导线 导线 about -- the Golden Desert . 
these 导线 transmission , and they all 安培 current . 
now some of you might say , engineers , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do it , because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 planet than the temperature of the space between these 导线 can transmission of electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 of 电磁铁 接点 on a technology for a mistake . 
and so 导线 temperature rise to a little bit more of the transmission it , and the current 安培 by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnets up the material they move about a mile constructed . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet damage . 
they have to work , unloaded has done . 
we gave them joy , it &apos;s good . 
now , they &apos;re back to the ground . 
in about three of refer to be the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to start it , and in six July to get the data , and we find out the mission of the most basic of the universe . 
now obviously , on the one hand , the accident , so to about cutting-edge science and engineering , but that &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think this task , but we still too difficult for the fact that the projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
thank you . thank you .

I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event , however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , I have to make a specific event , and I think again about the relationship between my work . 
now , it turns out to people , and I think this is my life , and now it turns out to people , and I think this is my life . 
this is , really , really , saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very to come up with , and I said , “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was around in the same question , people say , you don &apos;t of will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of going to collapse on you ? 
you end up in the fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , and I was always get question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all these people , until today . 
yes , all these people , until today . 
actually , except that , I was afraid of a lot of people don &apos;t think that this actually , I was afraid of a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people are afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? 
no one said : “ John , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ” ? 
could never ask this happened . 
and of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer this group , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world , and not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early in the last century , with great geniuses 英年早逝 just look at the early in the case of a century , the field with great geniuses 英年早逝 is often the case before died . 
even if the suicide , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent . 
the 曼梅 , died in the last time I said , in every book “ 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , this is how the radical . 
today I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in 
not only that , and terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
not only that , and terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century 可憎 , not only that , and horrible , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses live to be more . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I myself , believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I &apos;m 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and frankly , in that we all talk about that long , and I said , quote , &quot; and the friends , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , this is what the idea . 
is this idea , to make people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . is this idea , to make people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
and after a deeper , I think , to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from anxiety writing itself , and I had the response . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go back to the problem . 
in the ancient Greek and the ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and the ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and the ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a kind of sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the people who come to call this kind of creative 精灵 for “ ” stewards for 
and people often think Socrates stewards for this is from a distance , give him a general wisdom was that people think that -- Socrates , a stewards for that gives him from a distance . 
the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius , the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent , wonderful this view of Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is amazing , this is what I &apos;m looking for that is to make this safe distance from people who work on protecting the psychological 成败 . 
we can understand it works , right ? 
by this ancient artists , and get protection of the ancient artist narcissistic by this and get to protect , narcissistic too . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of ” “ genius of the project . 
if you work a terrible , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ ” genius , very bad . 
this is in the last Westerners for a long time to think about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes , the sun swallow this for vulnerable individual , is too big . 
this is a distorted completely of people , and for people that the expansion of the great achievement , completely straight up twisted , one of the cognitive , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of get an artist , and I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years , killed millions of artists . 
and if that is true , at least , I think , is this so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 of ideas , the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
maybe I can convince you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you had this experience of the creative process will know that don &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , and sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
like a breath of on her face , and the outpouring 
she can feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she can feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : on the other , and this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , there are almost 错过 poem . 
and then she would take out the other hand , it &apos;s a poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poem , which is just in the order of upside down , from the beginning , by the word , to go after the first words . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process , and it &apos;s not all of the creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I work , so much more like a way . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get the idea of an accident , but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get an accident . 
in a lot of people might have similar experience . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
and what &apos;s going on ? 
in how we &apos;re going to look at it , not rational ? we have lost in how to think about it , don &apos;t have lost rational ?

the people , to know what it is , they can call it the name of the people , to know what it is , they can call it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of : all are cheering you on your way to “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , really , that &apos;s great , great , and that &apos;s miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 artists to wake up , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn wake up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , that is , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to go to heaven , and the old , and he couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe we will not dance , when he was all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should from ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the most of my self cognitive , one of the pain . 
this is a very hard question , which is the most of my cognitive , one of the pain of self , this is a very hard question , which is the most of my self cognitive , one of the pain . 
but maybe , we have been so painful , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed .

if you didn &apos;t , and you hold dancing , keep jobs , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
if you didn &apos;t , and you hold dancing , keep jobs , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . thank you .

Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists that is worth more than the predictions about , and that for his ” “ clean coal . 
for Al Gore recently : climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the past , the size of South America by a 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but these are not exactly this question of , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the global climate system of the heart . 
in the summer , and actually hyperextending heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in a piece of the last 25 years . 
the red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter , and this is a form of the Year in the summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing permanent “ ” form , is five or more of ice , you see , it &apos;s like the blood to 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a huge amount of carbon and by was freezing . 干冰 defrost , methane , carbon clean microbes . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of the global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has been , you can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a melting of the year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is the southwest Greenland kangerlussuaq the river . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
there are dramatic rise of the traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report to reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see the new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world for the water from the -- half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice , drinking water . 
in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent less every year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry big number . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of 七十五年 four times more early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we increase the ocean every day 七千万吨 CO2 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India was on the continent and dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
the United States is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a more on the planet , carbon coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
this is what has and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what I think of . 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee out of coal muck billions of dollars . 
you see on the news . 
here , the second largest put the water . 
this is what happens before Christmas of 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see the more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
every day and cool coal in more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , where the coal . 
the most is the head of the coal mining massey 
so , climate protection is the work of people , and one of the current and to two projects . 
this is one of the part of one of them . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean the smell . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at the art as clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and burn coal , global warming is one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
look at it . this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
in the United States , the economic crisis , national security , climate crisis 
these are the strings together is based on carbon , like the product of oil on the imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve these problems . 
repower america with 100 percent of clean electricity in 10 years . 
the new work life , we get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america know more . 
and finally , a 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet , and this is to reduce the best way to rely on it . 
in the future . here , the wind , solar energy , new network of energy . 
the investment to create a new kind of work . 
repower has america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about play as you &apos;re in the building blocks . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . it is to understand and 空间结构 objects . 
to understand the object 空间结构 very helps us to a lot of learning things around . 
so the question of , I would keep in mind , and so we decided to find the answer , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable each other , sense each other , the 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
the most important thing is , 每块 siftable &apos;s , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information of the tools . 
this individual more tools , more sensitive to each other , any sense , the perception of subtle , so we can use this tool to try to some new interesting . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
they &apos;re typing a siftable it like this , if I put it to one side , so that it &apos;s in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put a 挨 a out , the interesting thing is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , and they would also be aware of , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other and perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like it , like the color , from a liquid that siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s three in the bucket paint siftables , we can put these bucket pour the color of the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions to learn to see more quickly , on-the-spot . 
this is also , I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable with dollars , and when you put together siftables letters of the word , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put the letters in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , some of the screen in the Media Lab children are involved in the test siftables experience , I put children of the experience . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the bottom right corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , is just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new graphics to add elements , what he did was to take up to the table siftables towards graphics , that you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he put it to the Sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David he put it in . 
in orange . 
do good . 
the graphics siftables to shake it , can bring new elements to this add up to his new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animation . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plan , his story . 
the balloon sitting off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function , playing music is even more recently , we developed , siftables in the function of sound , like a drum and 超载 note , and the sound . 
and there were 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can think of the sound of the modules siftable to sound editors tiles siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles tiles . 
there is something like a sound filter , which 响器 siftable of tiles . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
and then , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume of the modules to edit siftable tiles siftable to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put into the two tiles 超载 note , and some 超载 . 
now to join 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles tiles Drums , so that it can adjust sound . 
I just put up the rhythm of tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now , and come close to turn the filter sound filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can also . 
so don &apos;t need to play , but even in advance , all based , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with play , the tiles volume edited tiles on the left , to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium computer-human interaction with the better the brain works . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we developed a new generation sophisticated technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology , it &apos;s going to bring to the world of this change in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect about shared with you .
