rapture , through photos and stories , for National Geographic , the explorers by Wade Davis celebrated the diversity of the world extraordinary indigenous culture , that &apos;s an alarming rate , from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same kind of a flexible rule . 
we are all born 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience of the week 
you have to deal with the brutal 生离死别 and so we &apos;re going to sing and dance in 排遣 苦楚 of life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll see that each rhythm and pace , the music , dance has unique . 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you will now , a different way of thinking that you see the future . 
the culture of the world 五彩缤纷 犹如 by mental life and culture , a life of the Internet to cover the whole of the Earth , it &apos;s a very important 芸芸众生 , as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the Internet . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , and we as a very strong at the species . 
as the biosphere of race and the same with the same , and it &apos;s the end of the destruction of the faster . 
this one of the most important is that language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 kind of language . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is the human spirit , shining 
it &apos;s actually in the spirit of the unique culture in the material world 承 therapy . 
each one is a language that an ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate . 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that and we all in the same number of language , there &apos;s no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 unless we work , which means they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you would be the last 本族语 people can &apos;t tell ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , is a terrible about every two weeks on the planet will be with a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race to the race , and you have overall , and you come in to lose civilization . 
there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I said “ ” different way of living in front of it , and I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the Northwest 亚玛逊 in Arabic is that they &apos;re called the 蚺 race , because they believe in a time , which they 米尔克 coming from the of the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t tell the difference between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 , so in their 天穹 and forest , and no difference in the upper tree canopy . 
and they say , a strange kind of language , a unique and follow the rules that 通婚 异族 通婚 called went to the people with a different kind of language , married people . 
this is based on through the history of the mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon , because the wedding 异族 of language , there &apos;s a very often 六七种 you never see 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with the race to the northeast of Ecuador 华拉尼 is one of the most amazing race in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five year 1957 missionaries trying to get these people , but they made a mistake . 
they dropped from the air , they &apos;ve eight to 十张 . we think this is kind of , but they didn &apos;t think that life in the water regulation by rainforests of the people who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil . and they use with this missionary 戮 five . 
more of that is not only 华拉尼 external 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
we found only to investigate 一个八代 宗谱 两例 刨根问底 natural death , and they said , the truth , and the old people . it &apos;s going to wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have the 惊诧 revealed . 
they can smell a predator , 40 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in order to understand it . I have to figure out that the magic of religion voodoo taught how to teach isn &apos;t a voodoo and the dark . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about living , and it &apos;s the connection between 
in living soul . 
the rhythm can tap dances to 大水 soul of just replace the soul of the living in the short time for 侍僧成 flash of light . 
so , voodoo who like to say , you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
I &apos;ve been exposed to all of the community that lives in the north of the Columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny in ancient civilization , they were once conquered and in the area of the Columbia plain since they go back to the isolated in one of the plain . 
in this bloody ethnic of the globe has never been to the people . 
and they &apos;re going to be the monks 续 rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
they like to go back to the 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain the is these values -- with the universe , we can call it the relationship between the balance . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it . 
they call themselves to call lies over , we are in the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
it &apos;s not going to 多愁善感 Aboriginal people would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whatever it is a mountain of or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is really important for the relationship between the people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be the deforestation . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you know , they &apos;re very different way of life 
this is a picture of me last year in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent dopamine in the color of the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 from the people with serotonin , plants extract the nose and continuing . 
if you take a powder in these hallucinations , you &apos;ll see these wacky , in a very exciting . 
in reality in front of you , it &apos;s not distorted 荡然无存 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
the color dopamine to oral substance , and there are going to change and oral 氧化酶 dopamine in the other chemicals . 
what &apos;s interesting is that the 藤本植物 β 咔 啉 -- there was going to be able to control and play color dopamine agonists 氧化酶 clearly everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
we , ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask is to say that they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribes that people die in the cane is all in the deep jungle , they found that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask , how are they gave these hierarchy of plants , and they said , &quot; I want you to have some plants . 
you have some plants , and I say , don &apos;t know . 
I tell you that if they said in the months circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that would not let you get a Ph.D. in Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , and some of us with indigenous people think that compassion 离群索居 enrich their lives , but as we world forward . these people in the back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology . 
called the Sioux Indians , even if you put down , it &apos;s the Great Sioux Nation with Indians and the horse and carriage to sit still lives in the United States . 
the threat is not race intact change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we look at in Tibet , recently , where I do a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of the people living crimes are no denunciations , in many places , it was developed by a strategy of praise . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with that . 
and this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
the Chinese people immediately after he was killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together to Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
there are only two years old , and he and his mother and quietly in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister , and just by the 学习班 . 
one day she has to be with Mau on the president of the 臂章 and being a nation of 劳教 for seven years . 
the pain of Tibet elusive redemption through human need to get to see . 
and we &apos;re going to have a choice , we want to live in a world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve 60 drained . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
human time 新石器 revolution , we go into agriculture , to the top of the seeds , he would 腊 萨满 poetry is the rabbi . and we created a level of all of this 社会分工 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society 三百年 only in history . 
I think this brief history was enough to have the capacity for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully to the species that we have to make sure that all those 昌盛 race , and all of life . 
this picture was taken in the northern part of the 巴芬岛 up when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called the 奥拉雅 to me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government doesn &apos;t do the Inuit , in order to build a sovereign nation , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family worried that he put all of his safe , weapons , and the tools that are taken away . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is one of the thick . 
they sled , is the first slide of North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside , in his skin 长裤 shit . he wasn &apos;t until shit faster to fingers stiffen , he put it into a blades . 
and in this shit on the edge of the spitting 口水 blades , and then it became very frozen solid , and then he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
the skin of dog made out of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds and condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t get the shit knife made in the world . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all the Aboriginal people in the world of the life 顽强 becomes real . 
1999 four months to Canada , more than a area the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was a new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions , New Le 
this is a independent of where they control all of the ocean . 
this is very good example of a country can do something with it , to repair the relationship between the people . 
and finally , I think that used to go to the rural areas in the world , people are actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids to the world is part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about the fact that you can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on a month , thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
thank you . thank you . 
the Y arcas blaise aguera . in this stunning photosynth demo , the software that could change the way we see , using digital images from the static pick photosynth stunning photos , created a kind of , and you can go all around . 
blaise arcas photosynth agueray . 
we see there are lots and lots and lots of bytes 千兆 gigabytes . and in our digital photographs , and they can do for the full of by the way , you can look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
all the data , no matter how many , images of the images themselves , and there are , seadragon all have this ability to deal with . 
so most of the picture was taken by a digital camera , but this is a picture of it , it &apos;s a different from the scan images of the Library of Congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just , you can use 素数 . seadragon like of the screen , and it &apos;s a very , very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;m going to show you that this is really text , images , we can do this , and you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s a way to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
so this is a more , and this is an example of The Guardian . 
every image is a did starts . 
and the newspaper or a magazine version of the paper is the percentage of the images , in reading , people would get better reading reading experience , to enjoy . 
here we are doing this in a small change issues to &quot; The Guardian on . 
we make them up a high-resolution picture of the -- you see this kind of an average of high resolution , the picture , a lot of extra into . 
if you want to see this car , and you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way , to actually avoid the use of the screen . 
we want to be able to reduce this technology played out the window , and the kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and to deal with the top of the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it &apos;s actually kind of technology : two different . 
one is seadragon , and the other , is noah snavely graduate school at the University of Washington , that the computer vision . this research , Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Institute of Rick szeliski . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way to look at pictures , and to do at much more nuanced and have resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the space is actually a very significant . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of more than this place . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , this was 串联 in space . 
and then , we can so easily go to . 
and in fact , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
so , it was really exhilarating . 
I think you can see from these images , a lot of the camera phone camera , from a single to the . so a lot of different quality , in this environment , were all together . 
let me get some more weird . 
see , a lot of pictures of the visitors 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here , there should be a sequence of images -- ah , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to the poster , to see the whole of the environment . 
here &apos;s the point that we can work with the community . we can start to get everybody &apos;s data to collect different environmental memories together , to build a model . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all of them . 
this is a model , is the whole planet . 
and it &apos;s Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , and people used to be complex , become more valuable . 
pictures of the , you will be in . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right , you &apos;ll be able to this software , in the years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
the software . this is actually is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this is the process of 接合 based on the content . 
the more exciting is that contains a picture of text semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type of the word , will have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , the image with you ? 
at that time , so the semantic information in each of links , and that &apos;s great . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s unbelievable . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
and I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to go from a of principles . 
what kind of principles ? 
that &apos;s the Western society , not by 笃信 industry , a credo . 
the principles is to say that , if we want to get people to get the welfare state , its way is to make personal freedom to maximize . 
and the reason is free , and that is good , to value , for people . 
and once people have freedom , we can use to 做主 all the benefits , don &apos;t have to get people for 做主 . 
the freedom to be a way that &apos;s the selectivity of . 
the choice of the people , more and more freedom , freedom , get more and more of it . 
I think , the idea , like so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in that people didn &apos;t want to ask questions about it . 
and the same deep embedded in our daily lives . 
and I &apos;m going to show you some examples of modern society , look at the progress of development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
you see , this is a supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional sound system -- a speaker , CDs , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional sound system that &apos;s a lot more . 
with this store components , you can have a combination of all kinds of the last 650万种 three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , it &apos;s got to go and Maya , a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually , the phone , it &apos;s not going to die . 
that are 一去不返 days . 
now I &apos;m almost infinite variety of the phone , and that &apos;s a cell phone . . 
these are the future of the mobile phone . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , a cut hair , and the French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store , you don &apos;t worry about , and it doesn &apos;t take long , you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people went to the store , you have to ask : don &apos;t have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , say ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in the rest of the lives of more than a shopping thing for us , and the effect of the Big Bang . 
the health care -- in the United States , right now is that you don &apos;t go to the doctor , who tells you how to do so time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 . 
there &apos;s a very nail . and so forth and risk . 
and so forth , and I have a solution 乙 risk cure . you want to do ? 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
the doctors said these are very nail , again , and the risks , 乙 have the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” that ? 
they said , &quot; but I don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
now the prescription for all the ad is for you and I of the ordinary people . and if you think about it , it &apos;s just a little bit . and since we can &apos;t buy directly to the counter . 
why are we doing to promote market ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call a doctor , on a prescription drugs on them . 
now , as we the gender of the identity of this thing into a choice . it &apos;s like trying to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents to come down , but by themselves . 
so we can to shape the gender of our identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of women and men is the decision . 
in the marriage of in the family , everybody &apos;s got married . this is the age of things , and that &apos;s 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart , the best students , but now I give them the homework , less than ever before a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they were dumb , and the students . it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself , what am I going to get married or not ? should I now ? 
and then I &apos;ll come back to first child , I knew it work ? 
this is the problem of 脑筋 . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they do not do I work , whether they in my class and take a grades . 
they want to go to the problem , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now , do work , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can in one day , any time in any one corner of the Earth -- and of course , this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , where you can have a wireless Internet , but I &apos;m not going to tell you what . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
and we work with these incredible that we have the freedom of choice is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 on the phone , and the other 裤兜 blackberry BlackBerry , and it goes on the laptop . 
even if they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the children in rivals for , and to ask ourselves , and this is not the phone ? 
back to the email or not ? I don &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no , you know , the kids that this is the experience of the game is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big stuff , and it &apos;s way of life , life is . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there , but not to have nothing to do . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the problem is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know that it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these choices for people , and there are two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , for us . it &apos;s not , it &apos;s down , is paralysis . 
so a lot of people in the face of that is very , very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan for investment in terms of his retirement income . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest in vanguard . vanguard of a foundation is a big companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office . 
and she found is that when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 people than you down for five , 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it &apos;s even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
a major tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
this is not to plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so , it &apos;s a lot of paralysis . 
it makes our world looks like this and this slide . 
and when you go into the 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose a foundation , or it &apos;s salad ingredients . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
the more choices , the easy thing to some strange to feel regret . this is one of them , is always choice , not happy with their own decisions . 
and second , is what economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today . so Dan Gilbert told a enough is , we see a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of options , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the side of it . that makes you like to think that you see the 美中不足 . 
let me give you an example . and that , and if you are not the New York , I have a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it can be better than this ? this is where it was really bad , huh , “ ” “ ” in August , is now . 
Manhattan “ of your neighbors are not ” at home . 
I &apos;m going to “ is to stop that can go back to my door . ” . 
two weeks , and he was such an idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the opportunity . 
the opportunity cost “ ” always let the decided not to have to do with it , even if it &apos;s actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these choices , the more of it , and all these things that opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it &apos;s also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but , one of them and the reason is , when you choose to do something , you just have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing is to have a lot of you decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
it &apos;s time I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to have washed so many times , that it had become 凑合 . 
so , that many , many years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want to have a jeans , this is the size of the ” me . 
and said , you have to type , the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 , or maybe wash ? 
come to that grinds them ? 
and the , or to the ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw , almost off . and when I got over , and I said , I &apos;m going to “ that was the ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a I never had the most 合身 out of the door . 
I don &apos;t do it . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for me to make excuses . 
I feel even worse , which is , because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a jeans , what &apos;s great to be a good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans was a much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I had to me , and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives , together , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations and the other people how to do that . 
that &apos;s just not so good for the people , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not understand this , because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all the bad things are better than now . 
when one of the reason is that , how good people could experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , industrial of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you can only hope than you would expect it . 
what you will be no surprise , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing , and I didn &apos;t 凑合 , what I &apos;m trying to do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
now there are hundreds of on the jeans for you , you buy a back , it doesn &apos;t , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
on out there with hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t have any excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good to be disappointed . to blame myself . 
in our generation of the past , in the industrialized world and in the developed world is clinically depressed . explosive growth . 
and finally , the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this is the choice , happiness , of principles , and we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no doubt have no choice , but can &apos;t just the more choices that picture . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond our ’ ‘ choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now , let &apos;s talk about a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many choices , a lot of matter . 
the world , and there &apos;s a lot of places , at least , we &apos;ve heard about a few of them , where it &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday indignant , said , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seat 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated . it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us as before . 
this is what economists call 帕累 and improve . 
redistribution products to all people , it &apos;s not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us out of a pandemic . 
the end of the , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position “ guy , huh , this fish , know what ? 
to tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting , it is . 
but the more , I want to be clear that it was a fish . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the happiness . 
you increase the is , is the paralyzed . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish . so , for this fish is small , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish and that means to be suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects about the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to the digital code to a new design biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to come up with some big problems . 
what is life “ ” , I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists to try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years , the digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it &apos;s the world from analog in biology , computer analysis September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the genetic sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome in the lab to replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we &apos;re able to separate out from the 500组 一百组 is that we see these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its part of the most fundamental to continue to ask the question . 
and so we started to walk along the way we can “ ? ” synthetic chromosomes . 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
we are the digital life in an exponential rate faster . 
we have the ability of the genetic code progress very slowly , but also in the . we recently , it &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work , 15 years ago . 
in fact , it was for the first stage . we do in the first time , the biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a process of the back , the more fragmented , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is the first attempt to Phi X 174 , from the genome and phage digital information . 
it &apos;s a small can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
and the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , and I think they understand this very well . 
and the more than you laughing out loud . 
so we think this is actually the software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer . that started using digital information to the digital information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , the gene sequencing for every 10,000 is basically a mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to 30 , on average , it &apos;s wrong . and if we use the genetic sequence , this would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of 50 character and the other than the character of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
one of the design of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about the genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments enzyme . some enzymes bias , to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time and time getting out , and at a time . 
at every stage , we had a lot of culture that sequence , so we can give them , because we want to create a very reliable . you &apos;re going to see in a minute . 
we try to be automatic level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep in the coil . for longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology to repair the DNA , it &apos;s time to put them together . 
here &apos;s an example , there &apos;s a microbial called resistant to be able to afford radiation 球菌 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images of the chromosomes , and it in different places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it has to go back and combinations of before . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule . these microscopic process , which is what the yeast , and we put it in the way we design and the right . they talk to the yeast , automatically . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just the regular optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the trial . 
this is more than the genetic code 580000 character . it &apos;s by humans setting the structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font , print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple , with a bacteria is much more complicated . 
we deal with this kind of like that and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in a different cell , and this is what you heard about cloned . 
and for the bacteria , the chromosomes 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also know that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to the other cells and activate it . 
the new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this just that . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species , or the chromosome , the third side , in the thousands and thousands of seconds , a new features to its own . 
people who were in the process of evolution , and that &apos;s a genetic change of the ideas are missing a lot of it . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes is to be able to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of the cells , no , no and enzymes , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it &apos;s about it , and recognize the other , it &apos;s the matter is to digest , and finally , we have a have new DNA . 
we put into the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the species out of the characteristics , and completely gone into a new species , we put the cells on the new software “ ” . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , in fact , is that we put into it . 
this may seem like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
I think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own , and I was born in 1946 . 
now in the world would be the three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , in four . 
we provide the food for 65亿 , clean fresh water , medicine , the fuel is very , very difficult . 
which nine billion people , and that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this program , or any organisms that can replace it , and this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material in the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world , there &apos;s about a database of 两千万组 genes , and I like to see them as the design components of the future . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because what we call that can make the ” “ mix of the synthesis of the way . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard . we can choose to live , the ability to choose , chemical production , or the fuel vaccine production and so on . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is , we actually sit in the computer to really design of the species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on the ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see corn ethanol . it &apos;s just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
and one of the CO2 is a way -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a by that , in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to collect their , and then they &apos;re very easy to deal with , was introduced into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; , the fundamental problem . 
we really have the whole oil industry , with the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there ? be a major . 
and we also use the same tool in made out of vaccines . 
you can all of this flu , we &apos;re always going on , and in a year , the lack of money , when the vaccine . 
and I think this can be a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last thing is that and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough to long , long time , maybe you can do that . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox which shares some super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : what the LHC out ? 
last year at TED , I introduced the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to work , because it is the machine . 
and here it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the ground in Geneva . 
we use the little changes to the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas of the photos . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of the LHC along the way , as we all plan with the LHC , in part of a lot of particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see in September the 10th of this picture , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know , this is a 满堂喝彩 is this -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work on this with the culture of it as a research . 
but about a week later , we machine out of the main point with these 导线 导线 -- the gold . 
these 导线 transmission , and they all 安培 current . 
now , some of the engineers amongst you might say , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do it because they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
and so on the planet below minus 271摄氏度 between the temperature of the space of these 导线 can transmission of electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 of a technology for the 接点 , there &apos;s a mistake . 
and so 导线 temperature rise to a little bit of it , and then they conduction 安培 by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet material they move it weighs about a mile rule . 
so there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
they unloaded , put down to the work done . 
we gave them joy , it &apos;s good . 
now , they &apos;re back to the ground . 
in about three to refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data , and then continue our mission to find out the universe , the most basic units . 
now , obviously , so one of the accident to a cutting-edge science and engineering , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
and I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still projects of itself , and that &apos;s the value of the LHC . 
thank you . thank you . 
Elizabeth Gilbert 呵护 . about creativity and make them . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
and I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , but nonetheless , a specific event recently in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where people are , I think this is the result is that life , and no matter where people are , I think this is my life . 
so , really , really , saved , 完了 ! 
they would be very to come up to me and said , “ ? no . you not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t of will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of going to take you to bearing down upon ? 
you end up in the broken dream of despair , died in the center , and I was always get questioning , and so on and so forth . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
and beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t think that this actually , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people are afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? 
no one said , &quot; John , chemical “ work with the bottlenecks ” ? ? 
it could never ask . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , it just doesn &apos;t in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world , and not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses 英年早逝 creativity is always been the case of suicide . 
even if the suicide , it &apos;s not completely out of their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent . 
and , in 曼梅 died in the last time I said , “ every one of the 蚕食 ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , this is how aggressive . 
today I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of the outside in 
it &apos;s not only 可憎 , and , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
it &apos;s not only 可憎 , and , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century , and that &apos;s not only 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
I think we encouraged the great geniuses live to be more . 
and I myself , believed that I &apos;m going to be in the dark matter , due to myself , and I believed that it &apos;s going to me , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career , right now . 
you see , I was young , to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I was 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and frankly , in that we all talk about that long , and I say , is the heart and friends , right , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of idea . 
is this idea , to start a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back , is this idea , to start a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
and after a deeper , I think , to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from the anxious , writing , and I had the response . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go back to the problem . 
in the ancient Greek and the ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and the ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and the ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose and unknowable from far away to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the people who come to call this kind of creative 精灵 as stewards for “ ” 
and people often think Socrates there &apos;s a stewards for that , from a distance to give him to think that general wisdom and Socrates there &apos;s a stewards for that gives him , from a distance . 
people have similar to the point of view , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius , the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent , this wonderful of Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
this is amazing , and that &apos;s what I was looking at the security , and that &apos;s what makes people from work on protecting the 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by the artist that and get to protect , the narcissistic ancient artists , by this idea , and get the protection of narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of “ ” genius of the project . 
if you work is terrible , but not all of you . 
we all know that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is in the Western for a long time to think about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he &apos;s otherwise completely normal to swallow in the sun , that the individuals are vulnerable , is too big . 
this was completely straight up twisted , one of the cognitive , and to make an individual . completely down to this one &apos;s perception , and for people could have done . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of get an artist , and I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of get an artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least I think , is this so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the old , and they go to the reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the old , and they go to the reference for understanding of creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes , out of the question-asking 500多年 ideas of the reason we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes , the question-asking 500多年 out of the reason . 
so , maybe I can &apos;t convinced you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any trying to make people believe that in all of you had that experience will know , I don &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , and sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
like this , on the Mall , really , and the next to her . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing is to really “ dashed across ” 
on the other , and this is called me the most amazing part : on the other , and this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , there are almost 错过 poem . 
and then she would take out the other hand , and that &apos;s a poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , it will intact , which is just in the order of the upside down , from the last word go by , and , to the first words . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my work is so much more like the way . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get the idea of an accident , but even 古板 , sometimes I get inspired by accident . 
in a lot of people might have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on here ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it will not rational , loss ? we &apos;re going to see how it will not rational , loss ? 
he was going to capture it , but there &apos;s no way , he didn &apos;t pen and paper , there are a tape recorder , and he wanted to capture it , but there &apos;s no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder , and the pen and paper . 
I don &apos;t “ , I don &apos;t ”

it doesn &apos;t work , he still is completely dark . 
he can inspiration , and this is the unknown between the weird and surprising and strange relationship to his inspiration , and this is the unknown between the weird and surprising and strange relationship that &apos;s one of its own . 
this story pernicious to change the way I work , this transformation has saved me this story pernicious to change the way I work , and it has saved me . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I started to think I should give up to write this book . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I started to think I should give up to write this book .

the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer and the professional performing a wonderful , because they &apos;re all the professional dancer . 
occasionally , and very few , but actually going to happen , one thing was going to go beyond the 出世 . 
you know , I say this , because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , like that . 
time to stop , and through time . it seems to stop it , the dancers through what he did before , and the 1000场 performance , and all the different , but it amazingly , together . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , from the bottom . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , he was coming from the bottom of the sacred shine . 
the people , to know what it is , they can , it was called the name of the people , to know what it is , they can name it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
in Spain , when a performer done some incredible when the magic of people are going to give you all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , really , really great , great , and that &apos;s an incredible ” miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 for artists to wake up , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 wake up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , that is , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , the older people are going to go for it , and he couldn &apos;t get the height of the last night . 
maybe he never would you all are cheering you on your way miracles dance with him since I be ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creation of knowledge , one of the self . 
this is a very hard question , which is the creation of self , understanding the pain of this is a very hard question , which is the creation of knowledge , one of the self . 
but maybe , we don &apos;t have been so painful , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
so if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ , don &apos;t fear . you just have to do good ” that part of the work . 
“ , don &apos;t fear . you just have to do good ” that part of the work . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : if you are , it &apos;s dancing . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : if you are , it &apos;s dancing . 
if you didn &apos;t , it &apos;s just keep dancing , hold your jobs , and I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
if you didn &apos;t , it &apos;s just keep dancing , hold your jobs , and I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way for you . 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . thank you . 
thank you . thank you . thank you . 
you 嘞 ! 
from Al Gore here at TED , a new global , think of the climate scientists , more than a trend to worry about that , and he for “ ” clean coal . 
Al Gore recently : in the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m going to show you two of the polar ice cap 三百万年 here in the past , the size of South America by a 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but it can &apos;t show it because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the heart of the climate system . 
the heart , in the summer , and actually hyperextending . 
I &apos;m going to show you is a piece of the last 25 years . 
the red is a permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s a year in the dark blue is this ice formed in the context of the Year in the summer ice was freezing . 
what was freezing “ ” context , I &apos;m talking about five or more , and the ice , you see , it &apos;s like the blood to 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect of the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a huge amount of carbon and by was freezing . 干冰 defrost , methane , carbon and clean . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the amount of the global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has been , you can see , went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she was very well , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is one of the last year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is a river kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the ice is to sea level rise , and here it is the mouth of the Nung 
here &apos;s the traffic is rising . 
the South Pole , on the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
and last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and a few below sea level is accelerating the melting . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest ice in himalayas , at the top , you can see the new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world -- to get from the other half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of the ice , drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent less every year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
the world in a fire and dry to dramatically increase the numbers . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of the speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of 七十五年 four times more early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years , we &apos;re adding CO2 to the ocean every day 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India , when the continents and dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , except for 20 percent of the oil fuel is burning . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
the United States is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a more carbon in the coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what &apos;s the and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
coal oil industry , and carbon in the last year , and spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what I think . 
before Christmas , in my hometown , Tennessee , billions of dollars to the muck up the coal . 
you see on the news . 
here , the second largest waste , put it up . 
and the before and after Christmas . 
this is one of the carbon -- coal industries . 
and the coal cool is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see plenty more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
and the coal cool every day to become more healthy . 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s west virginia , where a lot of coal . 
the most is the head of the coal mining massey 
so this is the work of people -- and now , one of the on two projects . 
this is one of them , one part of it . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of coal mining and define what the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean do . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art clean coal , like the factory . 
some 喧哗 ! machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
and burn coal , global warming is one of the main reasons why you see the clean coal fascinated technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now the clean coal technology . 
this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
the U.S. economy is a crisis , national security , the climate crisis . 
these are the strings together is based on carbon oil products , like on the imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve the problem . 
repower america clean with 100 percent of the last 10 years of electricity . 
the new work that we get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
and finally , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , know more . 
and finally , a 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet , and this is , let &apos;s cut on the other way . 
in the future . here , the wind , solar energy , new network . 
the investment to create a new kind of work . 
repower has america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables -- to show you a toy . 
first of all , I want you to think about as you play in the building blocks . 
and when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . it is to understand and 空间结构 objects . 
understanding of the 空间结构 very good for us to learn a lot of things around . 
and so the question of sitting in my mind , and so we decided to find the answer , so to have this siftables . 
basically , which is a siftable interact with a computer , it &apos;s like the crackers . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable each other , sense each other , and the 每块 siftable monitor and radio device . 
the most important thing is , 每块 siftable &apos;s , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information . 
this individual tools , more and more sensitive to each other , with the senses , feel anything , so we can use this kind of interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
it &apos;s this siftable reflection , if I put it to the side of it , so that &apos;s in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put a 挨 a out , the interesting thing is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , and they would also be aware of , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other , and the perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like that , for example , down to the color , from a siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s in three siftables barrels of oil paint patterns , we can put into the barrel of color in the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions to learn to see , on-the-spot faster . 
this is also , I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this together in a game , you just take a piece of a letter siftable dollars , and when you put them together siftables letters of the word , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , some of the screen in the Media Lab children are involved in the test siftables experience , I put the children of the experience . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables in some people experience . 
the bottom right corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just of siftables together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new elements in animation image , what he did was put on the table , towards the siftables pick up some graphics , you can put it to the new element . 
see , and he put up the sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now , and he put it in . 
in orange . 
do good . 
in the siftables graphics can bring forth a new elements to this new elements , and he put up -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of Project , and how stories . 
the balloon down off . 
and I &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function in , playing music is even more recently , we &apos;ve developed siftables . in this , to sound frequencies , and like 超载 and drum . 
and there were 四档 for change , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a filter , which 响器 , like the siftable module . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume edited siftable tiles tiles siftable to adjust the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two tiles 超载 into edit , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums , so that it can adjust tiles . 
I &apos;m going to need to accelerate the pace of rhythm to edit tiles module . 
now , and then bring a voice to turn the filter tiles tiles . 
music playing in the process , we can do . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance , but in all playing based , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles on the left , to come to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new kind of human-computer interaction with the brain , the better . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to talk to you in the idea is that we developed a new generation sophisticated technology -- and the digital media 接轨 technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
