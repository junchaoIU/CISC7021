through rapture photos and stories , for National Geographic , the explorers by Wade Davis celebrate culture indigenous people around the world extraordinary , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate disappear from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
and of course , we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience the adult would showered . 
we have the brutal 生离死别 , so we need to sing and dance with 排遣 life 苦楚 we create art . 
but you &apos;ll notice that every culture songs rhythm and pace dance has unique signature . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you can now send this thinking will let you see hope . 
the world of cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by a mental life and culture interwoven into life and the Internet cover the whole Earth it for a very important 芸芸众生 Earth as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the ecology . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity is very strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
as the biosphere as the erosion of ethnic circles are facing the same shorter , and it was the destruction of the faster . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s all of the spirit of the unique culture in this material actually 承 carriers of the world . 
every language is a kind of conscious minds with a mental ecosystem long-term precipitation and accumulate 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that and we all the same number of these languages in half no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that act , unless , effective rules , they will be completely gone . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
another terrifying reality is on the planet , about every two weeks , there will be a 仙逝 with is an ancient with language . 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find , you don &apos;t say , their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore this race to loop loop , race , you have overall , and let you personally feel in unraveling civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I said “ ” in front of the survival of the different ways , I said “ different ” way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 Northwest Bala Caesar pulled areas that they &apos;re called 蚺 of a political race , because they believe that they 米尔克 coming from the river was born of the sacred about snakes . 
the groups of people can &apos;t distinguish blue and green is the forest , because they 栖身 of their so in the forest canopy 天穹 with no difference . 
they say , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 called 异族 linguistics 通婚 with the people who have a different languages , married people . 
this is based on the history of mythology lineage down , you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding , there &apos;s a very often 六七种 language , you never see somebody 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was exposed to the many ethnic Ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 tribals is one of the most amazing race in 1958 , I used to that they had peace friendly . 
five year 1957 missionaries trying to get these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air , eight to 十张 their pictures of himself in our mind , it &apos;s kind of , but they don &apos;t think these live in the water regulation by rainforests , who had never seen pictures of two-dimensional 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use 戮 with this missionary five died . 
it &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 戮 external die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is by their own tribals 戮 dead . 
we found only 一个八代 宗谱 to investigate 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the more old people go to the wood , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have astonishing forest 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell unsporting characters , 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know that &apos;s what the animal urine . 
in order to understand the secret I have to figure out this amazing religious voodoo taught how voodoo teach isn &apos;t a dark the magic . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the most important in the world religions , will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
voodoo unique about it was born with a connection between them . 
living in the spirit . 
the dance rhythm can tap Outreach soul 大水 below just replace living soul in this brief shining moment 侍僧成 for God . 
so , voodoo believers , like to say , you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
I &apos;ve been exposed to all of the community that lives in the mountains in northern Columbia Santa 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is a race tyranny ancient civilization , they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of a plain isolated mountains . 
in this continent the globe bloody ethnic was never Hispanic conquer . 
and today they 续 along with monk would rule institutions , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
they like to go back to the 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain is these values , and the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you want to protect it . 
they call themselves for lies for over , we say we are destroying the world . 
this intuition , the ability to create a very important . 
indigenous will not 多愁善感 wouldn &apos;t tolerate 思乡 of torture 
so what does that mean ? 
whether the mountain gods is the shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be the deforestation . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this photo was me last year in August in Northwest Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
this is a potent dopamine color of the components of it , and within the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe , people will have from serotonin , plants extract this material and continuing nose . 
if you use a nose swallows the powder , you &apos;ll see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distorted 荡然无存 but 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine change . 
to oral these color dopamine matter have to change and oral 氧化酶 dopamine in the other chemicals . 
what &apos;s interesting is that the existence of 藤本植物 β -- 咔 啉 alone can suppress the dopamine agonists color 氧化酶 and play the potency of everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
we ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments repeatedly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask Indians , they &apos;ll say plants that would say . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person found the cane is that they all die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask , how are they gave these plants hierarchy , they said , &quot; I want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants have to know what I say , is not . 
so I told you , if they said in the months of growing in this circle of every plant to use the different languages singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , even though we some of the indigenous people think that they confront compassion 离群索居 enrich lives , but as we world forward . these people in the back to the edge of history . 
and all cultures have been influenced by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with interest is still Indians and American courtesy of the horse and carriage , life is still in the United States . 
the threat race intact layer is not change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
we look at in Tibet recently where I do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide endangered cultures , which is the destruction of the people lifestyle crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of the praise by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of withstand Tibet 
this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
China , he immediately after the invasion of people were killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together into Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
he was still there are only two of his mother , his quietly in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offends behavior , and by the 学习班 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the head of the hairs 臂章 and being in the crosshairs of 劳教 for seven years . 
the pain of Tibet for people to withstand human redemption mental need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 drained . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
新石器 into an agricultural revolution of human time , we would like to these seeds 腊 Beijerinck rabbi cheese 萨满 poetry is the motto of all , we created the level of 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society will only last 三百年 history . 
in my view , this brief history was enough to have the ability for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
when we went to the world for different cultures , the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that all the race , and all of the optimism 昌盛 prosperity for life . 
this picture , I was in the northern 巴芬岛 on the top of that I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about a about his grandfather &apos;s legendary story . 
in the 1950s , Canada , the government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family worried he was safe to put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the advantage of the day , thick . 
their sleds across the street in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of a fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear of the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he slept on the outside , wearing his skin seal 长裤 he put a stool to shit faster until fingers stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust after he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
off the skin dog made out of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds and condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t get the shit knife made in the world . 
this is really 空手 make life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 life becomes real . 
1999 four months of government to Canada than the size of Texas and California 之和 larger land returned back to the Inuit people . 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the New Le dimensions , 
this is a independent territory , where they control all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think for ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as the planet . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids dream with our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we believe that politicians will not make grades . 
we think and argue is not to convince others , but we think about the fact that we can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on a website to thousands of three , five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of readers magazine . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera Y arcas . in this stunning photosynth demo , the software that could change the way we watch digital images . use online pick out from the static photosynth created stunning photos , the dream , and we can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth demo . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of our digital photographs , they can do for and smooth in full by the way , you can look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
it can see how much data sets , images , how big and the images themselves , seadragon have this ability to deal with . 
so most of the show pictures were taken by digital cameras , but in this case is different , it &apos;s an image from the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it doesn &apos;t make any difference , because the limits of performance system , the only factor is just , you can use of the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is Dickens &quot; 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;ll give you that this is really text , rather than the images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
so this is a more practical , this is an example of The Guardian . 
every did is a picture of the opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people would get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we made small change in The Guardian issues that to the corner . 
we fictional a high-resolution picture advertising than normal -- that you see the normal advertising high resolution , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , and you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
this way , in a certain sense avoid the actual use of the screen . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and the kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , digital maps is so obvious , and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve created this field of our contribution . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
on top of the United States , and with the road map . 
now , we &apos;ll put down those , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different kinds of technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other recognizes from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely computer vision of what the research . this research seitz Steve Washington University . 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski help . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied , it &apos;s based on the seadragon technology building . 
you can see here , we can easily picture of the way to do , is able to look for images to have a more nuanced and at the resolution browsing experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very meaningful . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples , the more interesting than this space . 
mainly because we make a website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
DH : be honest , I never thought I would come and work for Microsoft . 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see the original these images from a lot of different camera phone camera , from a single professional to the . so a lot of different picture of quality , in this environment in put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so forth . 
I remember here , should have a series of photos -- ah , in here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to the poster to look at the rebuilding of the environment . 
so the important point here ? is effectively , we can use the Internet community . we can get from everybody &apos;s going to everybody for different environmental memory , collect together , to build a model . 
and when all these pictures intertwined , what &apos;s going to a much more than just take all . 
this model menacing , what is the whole planet . 
this is like Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
user , you will be in the tag . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand correctly , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years will come from the picture of the global 接合 together ? 
it &apos;s the real meaning . this software is to explore . 
it builds up in the middle picture hypertext . 
this 接合 process is completely based on the content of the picture . 
more exciting is that contains images of text semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a word type , after the text on the Web is going to have a lot of with this picture . 
now , with all these pictures of your image , it would be ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s unbelievable . congratulate you ! 
thank you very much . 
Barry 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I want to here to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I think from a solid credo . 
what kind of principles ? 
that &apos;s the Western industrial society , not by 笃信 a credo . 
the principles is to say that , if we allow people to get the welfare state , its way is to maximize to individual liberty . 
and the reason is free , with this stuff is beautiful , valuable , for people to do . 
and once people have freedom , each of us can 做主 ourselves with all the way the welfare , don &apos;t have to get people to 做主 for me . 
the freedom to be a way , is the largest increase the selectivity . 
people more choice is freedom , freedom , more and more and more of it . 
I think , this idea , like so that when you add it into the water in deep-seated presumption that that nobody wanted to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of contemporary look at the progress of social development have let us become possible to do something . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say here ingredients salad . 
you see , this is the supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional sound system -- speaker , CD machine , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system is countless more . 
with this store components that you can have 650万种 close out all the combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , let &apos;s talk about communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and that is to Maya Bell company , just this company . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually , the phone , it &apos;s not going to die . 
that day 一去不返 already . 
now I &apos;m almost infinite variety of cell phone , especially in that . exactly . 
these are the future of mobile phones . 
and I love most in the middle -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , nose and French forming a brownish caramel , cutting hair 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next shops seen , don &apos;t worry , not how you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : you have a don &apos;t take much function ? 
you want to , the answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in the rest of the lives of more than a shopping thing for us , this effect on the explosion of choice . 
the health care -- in the United States , right now are not that you go to the doctor , who tells you how to do so time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatments , nail , can also use 乙 solution . 
and so forth , and make a solution nail risk . 
and so forth , and very 乙 solutions are at risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , how do I do ” ? 
they say that again , nail has these effects 乙 risk , and there &apos;s the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” ? 
doctor : “ , but I don &apos;t you ” . 
now the prescription for pharmaceutical ad , are all for you , I of the ordinary people . and if you think about it , it &apos;s said isn &apos;t . and since we buy directly to the counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they hoped that we see an ad in the morning after would go to your doctor , the doctor to call on a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our identity , gender , this kind of thing became a choice . it &apos;s like trying to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we can get back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of men and women are the decision . 
in the marriage of families in the past , everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age for granted , and it &apos;s 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what node , and it &apos;s not married later what to do . 
and now , all the things you can get to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart magnificant students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they than ever before -- of students stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
the reason is , they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself : I should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to the kids , and I knew business ? 
these are a 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they do not do I assign homework , whether they in my class and take a grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because this is something important question . 
now do work , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technological progress in one day we can make any time , in any one corner of the Earth -- of course , that a basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , where you can actually have a wireless online , but I &apos;m not going to tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I also want to use . 
and we work with these incredible choice for our freedom of choice of what we need to make decisions , again , again , again , for their work now is to break moved . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 with the BlackBerry blackberry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even though they &apos;re closed , we still looking at the same rivals for kids in constantly ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
go back to this email or not ? I don &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no , you know , the kids that the experience of the game is still a big compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big , of the matter is lifestyle , lifestyle choice is . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there is nothing , but don &apos;t need choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know , it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these choices for people have two , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , say , there &apos;s some paradox , which is , we have to choose . it &apos;s not , but inside , is we numb . 
with so many choices that people want to make a decision , very difficult . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan to wait pension investment in terms of research . 
one of my colleagues had access to vanguard of investment . vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million employees and two , 000多个 office . 
she survey found is that when these customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of species increases every 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you provide 50种 fund employees , to provide people than you five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it is even more difficult , so you can put and tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow halide tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
don &apos;t join the plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so many possibilities , choice is the result of paralysis . 
it makes our world looks like this and this slide . 
when you go into the 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision that is correct , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose wrong helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
choice , more easily inexplicably something to feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction of choice . 
secondly , economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a enough , we see is a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of options , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the attractive . it makes you always was chosen for you to think that 美中不足 . 
for example , but it shows , and if you are not in New York , I &apos;ll 歉 a dish . 
but this is what you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it can be better than this ? this point in to “ huh , really , bad ” “ is now in August , ” . 
“ Manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
“ is I &apos;m going to go back to the car stop to my door ” . 
and for two weeks , he was such an idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the parking . 
the opportunity cost “ ” always let us to have good enough to make that decision , even if it &apos;s actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options , which is something more , these things are the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also said the “ ” present this idea . maybe , including things to do step . 
but , of a truth is , when you choose to do something , you just have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing that tend to have a lot of attract you decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
and in a time , I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in the long enough time to wash , after several times , pants to become 凑合 . 
so , this years old , I finally street to buy a new . I said , “ feed , I want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and said , you &apos;re going to the type of comfort , and the sweatpants ? 
in front of his buttons . it &apos;s going to pull locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
going that fast grinds them ? 
and the mouth , or to the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw , almost off . and I got over “ , I said , I &apos;m going to that is used to be the only a pattern ” . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and I spent a 钟头 then all of these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , I took a I never have the most 合身 pants out the door . 
I do not really wrong . those choices that I had the opportunity to do better . 
but you feel it worse . 
why ? it , and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , the reason is , because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a jeans , what &apos;s great to be good expectations greatly rise . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best at least a economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I got I had to , and I expect to compare , and I expected of me , this becomes disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together choice , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of how well beyond didn &apos;t give people has many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not know the truth . because if they have people understand , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this , but in comics , in all these things are very bad for the past , everything is better than now . 
the reason is , when one of the things are not good for people to experience that might have some surprises . 
now , in these rich , industrial of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you can only hope it &apos;s not than you would expect . 
you &apos;ll never be what surprises , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time to talk about myself , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing , I didn &apos;t 凑合 , what I &apos;m trying to do . 
but can 凑合 is not necessarily a bad thing . 
now in the store , there are hundreds of jeans for you , you buy a back , feel not happy , and you ask , why , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
out there on the hundreds of jeans , you have no excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good . disappointed to decide , to blame myself . 
in our past this generation , the industrialized world and in the developed world -- explosive growth is clinically depressed . 
and finally , the net effect is , even though the objective , we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this choice about the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . I don &apos;t . 
there &apos;s no choice , better than no choice , but not just this picture choose more is better . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know how many . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ choice we ’ rich to the critical value . 
I said . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , for our industrial society so many choices , is a material . 
the world , there &apos;s a lot of places , at least , we heard a few of them , where the problem is not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern wealthy Western society , a special issue . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday said , amazing indignant , the question is , we make those expensive and babies to operate the car seats 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated choice was not 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us as from ago . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us , like plague of extra choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position of intelligence , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
to tell you , in the fish tank , everything is ” impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting is to interpret it . 
but , I want to feel more clearly this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the was paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish . so why , for this fish , maybe a little , for us , almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s no such a fraction of the fish , which means that suffering is going to , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and meaning . and they found a new genome . 
this time , we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new design biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” , I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
we tried many ways , put it down to the tiny components . 
now we &apos;ve spent the last 20 years to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from the biology of September the analysis of the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s for a species can make the smallest genome in the lab , replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes 一百组 separate out is that we see these . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue to question the basic problem . 
so we started to walk along this path “ , we can synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life constantly in an exponential rate faster . 
we write the genetic code , the ability to progress very slowly , but also to increase in the recent . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it after several . we do the first trial ago , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
the 十几万台 device there in the little pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline of the manufacturing process , the fragments , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first attempt , from Phi X 174 genome phage , and the digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genetic pieces , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
the most exciting stage is when we put this didn &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually the software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that these digital information must be very accurate . 
when we first in 1995 for this group of subjects , gene sequencing is every 10,000 to a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to , on average , 30 is wrong . if we use the genetic sequence , this group would never have turned on . 
part of the design work is design for 50 character length and fragmented and the other 50 character long footage of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they get together . 
we have one of the design of the unique part . 
you may have heard in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code , and there are four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences words , the idea . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed when we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
we design these fragments , and we can use enzyme which cuts bias . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from 70 length of time to put them together make 24 and symbol than the length , and then bring out the merger fragments , become 72 , 1,800,000 long time . 
at every stage , we produce a lot of these fragments , so we can give them a sequence , because we wanted to create a very reliable process , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we try to reach automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very big fragments that more than 100 , 10,000 to basically , they &apos;re hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair the DNA , it can put together fragments 
here &apos;s an example of a microbial called tolerance 球菌 radiation to be able to withstand 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , its chromosomes nieces in different places . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , before the original . 
we have this can have thousands of microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule microscopic images . through this process , it &apos;s actually mentioned in front of the yeast , and put it right after we design pieces . yeast automatically and aggregates . 
this is not the electron microscope pictures ; it &apos;s just a regular optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
these are long , about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than 580000 character of genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and make the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple , with a bacteria is much more complicated . 
do we really like that nuclear biological and relatively simple , you can take a nuclei and into another cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to another cells and activate it . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species or chromosome , the third place in a seconds increased thousands and thousands of new features to its own . 
people who were in the process of evolution every would only have a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of creatures . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes is to digest of DNA . 
the chromosome out of cells , no , no , this enzyme this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it presents a out , and recognize another a chromosome is no matter , it &apos;s going to its digestive , finally , we have a have new DNA cells . 
we put into the gene that causes it became blue . 
in a very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put the cells ” “ new software . 
all the proteins are membrane changed , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , actually , it is that we will implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do this ? 
I think , for some reason , we need to do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world into three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , became four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 to provide food , clean fresh water , medicine , all the fuel , very difficult . 
which nine billion people , and that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature programs can replace or any of it , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material in the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world , there &apos;s a contains about 两千万组 genetic database , and I just love them as the future of design components . 
electrical industry , and there &apos;s only 10 to components , look at that we can get diversity . 
now , our main limited from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because these can produce what we call the mixing “ ” group of very synthetic . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that allows us to make a million chromosomes a day . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can live in the ability to choose , chemical production , or the fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that we actually sit work in the computer to design the species actually use software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad . 
soon we will have a second and third is sugar . fuel into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
and we think in 18 months , we get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide is one of the way -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep sea . about 1.5英里 deep , is almost in boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane into the molecules of its energy source . 
we could look at the collection of two , and they get their very convenient can be introduced process , into the fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic problem . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry , the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there ? become a major energy . 
and we also use the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you see this year of flu , we always have to slow the time of year , and lack of money in the case that when the vaccine . 
I think this is by mixing vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last is really a biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better farther away from human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough time , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 TED estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox which shares some super Collider , including the news . content is now in the nest maintenance workers and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
in the last year at TED , I introduced the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to update it is the machines running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
used to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we use these detectors for little photographing the Big Bang . 
this is the inaugural I work on , ATLAS . detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last September 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
it was the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of the LHC along the way , as we &apos;re planning with the LHC , part of a lot of particles in the heat 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know this is a 满堂喝彩 is this -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with a shock culture , and it also significant scientific . 
but about a week later , we machine out of a major with these 导线 about -- the Golden 导线 . 
these 导线 conduction 安培 current when they all machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers “ impossible , these wires ” too little . 
they can do , because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
and so on the planet below minus 271摄氏度 between the temperature of the space of these cases 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 in a 电磁铁 接点 have a technology to install a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to a little bit more of the transmission it 安培 current suddenly by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because those magnets are weigh up to 20 tons they move about a mile constructed . 
we have about 50 magnets impaired . 
to put them unloaded , these work done . 
we gave them joy , fix . 
now just waiting for them back to the ground . 
in about three or refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data , and then continue our mission to find out the universe , the most basic units . 
obviously , now , one of these accidents , again , so about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still projects in pursuit of facts itself , which is where the value of the LHC . 
thank you .

I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event , however , recently , in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
it turns out , and no matter where I , people think that this is my life as a result , no matter where I now , people think that this is my life . 
really , like , completely , saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very anxious to come with me and said , “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you are not beyond that book ” ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was being met the same question , people said , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of sustainable refused to take you bearing down upon ? 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , I was always get questioning , etc . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
actually , except that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know anything about it , except that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering recently , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is a cerebral idea ? 
people are afraid of doing your own destiny job ? this logic ? people afraid of doing your own destiny job ? this logic ? 
nobody “ said , &quot; John , chemical work met bottleneck ? how ” ? 
could never ask this happened . 
and of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer this group , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 and global , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
just look at the early last century , in areas with great geniuses 英年早逝 case just look at the early last century , in areas with great geniuses 英年早逝 case is often lightly died of suicide .

Noam 曼梅 , before he died in the last one interview I said , “ every book 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
for your work life , this is how radical statement . 
today I want to ask you is : you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask you is : you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of outside in 
this is not only 可憎 , and horrible , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 , and horrible , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century 可憎 , not only that , and horrible , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses live to be more . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I myself , believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of career 
and frankly , look at that we all talk about that long , and I said , quote friends out of the heart , right , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
is this idea , to make people on a 大清早 drank -- not wine on the road ? is this idea , to make people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to keep doing what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to keep doing what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deeper , in my opinion to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanism . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from extreme anxiety writing itself , and I work for outrage extreme anxious . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because the last would go back to our problem . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks universal to call this kind of creative accompanied 精灵 for “ ” stewards for 
and people often think Socrates there &apos;s a stewards for that , from a distance to give him wisdom was that people often think Socrates there is such a stewards for wisdom gives him from a distance . 
Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this is a wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent personal . 
this is amazing , this is what I &apos;m looking for that is to make this safe distance from people who work on 成败 psychological protect mechanism . 
we can understand it works , isn &apos;t it ? 
ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of genius “ ” help done . 
if you work really bad , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is the Westerners in the last for a long time about creativity . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , which for vulnerable individual , is too big . 
this was completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognitive , and for personal achievement was expanding expected that completely straight up twisted , one of the self cognitive , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring the artists , I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years , killed millions of artists . 
if that is true , at least I think , is this so we , the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to look at them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to reference for them to understand human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rationality human mind , we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
maybe I can convince you agree with me . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you had this experience will know creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
like on a breath of emptying down her face . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet .

in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she has almost 错过 poem . 
and then she would take out the other hand , grab that poem tail to get it back on the other hand , it will poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
when this poem intact , going to present on paper , except that sequence is upside down , from the beginning , by the word , go back to the first words . 
I heard her story , I thought : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my works more like a so 
but even 古板 occasionally , as I &apos;m going to get an incredible inspiration , but even 古板 occasionally , as I &apos;m going to get an accident . 
in a lot of people may also have similar experiences .

&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , from the bottom of the light and shine by sacred fire . 
clearly , people know what it is , they can call it the name of the time , people know exactly what it is , they can call it . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles phenotype . 
in Spain , when a performer done some incredible wondrous , people will give you all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , really , really great , wonderful , amazing is that miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn waking for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn awake at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , that is , he &apos;s no miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old mortals , maybe , and he couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe we will not dance to people in his all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should since ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creation of the most painful cognitive of self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the creation of self , one of the most painful cognitive , this is a very tricky issues , which is the creation of the most painful cognitive of self . 
but maybe , we have been so painful , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t . just do your part ” work . 
“ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t . just do your part ” work . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , that &apos;s dancing . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs , what is : if you &apos;re a dancer , that &apos;s dancing . 
if not , that would keep dancing , hold your jobs , and I still kept for you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
if not , that would keep dancing , hold your jobs , and I still kept for you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you 嘞 ! 
at TED , Al Gore from a new situation , the global climate trend that scientists are worth more than the predictions about that , and he for “ clean coal ” . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m going to show you two of the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the last demonstration of the size of South America by the equivalent of 48 state area reducing 40 percent . 
but these are not exactly this question of , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
it feels , polar ice cap -- just like the global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer actually hyperextending heart heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years may very well . 
red is a permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter , and this is a form of the Year in summer , ice permanent ice was freezing . 
the so-called “ permanent ” was freezing , I &apos;m talking about five or more form of ice , you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
to notice is that the greenhouse effect of the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and by the letter was freezing 干冰 . defrost clean from microbes , methane , carbon . 
if the breakthrough , greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has , you can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the professor of alaska katey walter 结队 went to a light lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s OK , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a melting of the year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is the southwest Greenland kangerlussuaq river . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
here is a dramatic rise in traffic . 
the Earth , the other side of this planet , the largest ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report to reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world from its molten get half of the drinking water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice , drinking water . 
traffic was . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
in California , Sierra of snow 40 percent reduction per year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
global dry . in a fire to dramatically increase the numbers . 
and the world population is absolute disaster in an unprecedented remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are in relation to number four 七十五年 earlier . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the past five years we added CO2 into the ocean every 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India was on the continent dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of the biggest reason of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil fuel is 20 percent . 
the oil is very important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what some of the has and some new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
the picture , reminded me of ? 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee dig billions of coal muck up . 
you probably saw in the news . 
here , the second largest waste , put up . 
this happens to the Christmas back and forward . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal carbon advertising industry . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see him up more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
coal Mr. cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s a lot of west virginia , where the coal . 
the biggest the head is the coal mining massey 
so Al Gore and climate protection of work is one of the current and launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s the smell of clean . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s go to look like the art of clean coal factory . 
spectacular 喧哗 some machine . 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal is global warming , one of the main reasons why you can see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
take a look ! this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security challenges . 
the United States are in the economic crisis , national security , climate crisis 
these are the strings together is based on carbon oil products on like dirty imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
repower america with 100 percent of clean electricity use a decade of time . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and let the Earth isn &apos;t in global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , understand more . 
the final 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet , this is for us to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
the future is in here . the wind , solar energy , new network . 
new investment to create something more money . 
repower america . it &apos;s time has ! 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want to please recall a time , if you played kit . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is the object 空间结构 to understand and perception . 
to understand the object 空间结构 really helps us to a lot of learning things around . 
so the question I would keep in mind , so we decided to find answers , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
siftables can use my hands , moving randomly 每块 siftable can perceive moves , each one of the 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
this individual more tools , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any subtle , so we can use this tool to try to some new interesting interaction . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
this is like configuration siftable reflection , if I put it to one side , so it &apos;s in this picture shows , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put a 挨 a resounding OK , interesting phenomenon that &apos;s going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , and they would also be aware of , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can perceive moves with each other . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down , put colors , from a siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , there are three sets of patterns to paint barrel siftables , we can put these bucket pour the color of the middle of the color , which together . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions , on-the-spot learning to become more quickly see the results . 
this is also , I &apos;m here to show siftables reason -- is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable , when you put dollars with the letters siftables together , the words of siftables in dictionaries automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of letters of the words , you can try to put the letters in other words , new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , on the screen some kids are in the Media Lab involved in the test siftables experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word “ spell ” game , they know what to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new graphics to add elements , what he did was to the table siftables pick up some graphics towards it , can bring these new add elements to animation . 
see , he put the sun add up . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now he put tractors add up . 
in orange . 
do good ! 
put siftables to shake graphics that can bring new add elements to this add up to his new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open , and he &apos;s in the end of the story of how plan stories . 
the balloon sitting off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function , playing music is even more recently , we developed , siftables that function in sound domain , can make like 超载 frequencies , the sound of drums and Bess . 
everybody has tiles 四档 for modulation , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable hit you like . 
voice , just to put sound to edit tiles module . 
there is something like 响器 with the sound filter , a siftable module . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control master rhythm and volume of tiles siftable near the editor of tiles siftable to adjust rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put into 超载 note two editors , plus some tiles 超载 . 
now to join 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to put sound filter near Drums tiles modules , so you can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to accelerate the pace of just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to put sound filter tiles , Bessel filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can also . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance , but in all playing based , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited near tiles tiles on the left , with the place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium for computer-human interaction better fit the human brain works . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation sophisticated technology -- can and digital media 接轨 technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
