through rapture photos and stories , for National Geographic by Wade Davis explorers of indigenous peoples to celebrate culture as the world , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate , from Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me , traveling around the world and in anthropology research career -- one of the experience is not forget the traditional community , to live in the breeze touched by rainwater wash 晶莹 shining stone had with the taste of bitter lobes , you can feel their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 tigers are Inuit directly to cross the myth that still notion of empathy , or in the Himalayas Buddhist or in following 法门 that remind us of anthropology at its core ideas responsibility is not the world we live in an absolutely consciousness , it &apos;s just a physical model for sexual selection merely a result , our ancestors in many generations ago we made that choice . 
of course we all follow the same sort of flexible rule . 
we are now born to 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we have to go through the adult showered week . 
we have cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find each songs rhythm and pace unique identity with dance 
whether we &apos;re living in the jungle Krishna 伯南人 or in Haiti taught voodoo 侍僧 or Northern Kenya Julius Sue 武士 安迪斯 mountains , desert 巫医 or the middle of the Sahara desert jerk hotel month I used to work together to the person who is a desert 结伴 牦牛 牧养人 in hoist Everest hill . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now 
if you think you can now send the thinking that makes you see the future . 
the world by 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 a spiritual life and the culture of Internet cover the whole planet Earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important point as we call the biosphere as important as the web . 
you can put it in a culture of the web as a species , the race loop loop that can be defined as a human since self-aware shrouded by imagination to create all the ideas and dreams , myths and all 之和 intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s our identity -- we have a strong exploring as a species . 
as the biosphere , all of the same race caps also facing the same shorter and its destruction faster . 
no one can say a 50 percent or more species extinct , or at the brink of extinction , because it &apos;s not the biodiversity of the most pessimistic situation would rather than the diversity of the most optimistic . 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet that has 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is the human spirit , shining 
it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the spirit of matter in the world &apos;s 承 carrier . 
each one language is a conscious mind an ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate . 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that we all at the same amount of language , there is no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that do work unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last thing where people can &apos;t 本族语 lineage of wisdom and allowed to predict the future of children , so that &apos;s how lonely and scary . 
another spooky is on the planet , about every two weeks will be accompanied with a 仙逝 is an ancient language . 
I know some people say that you wouldn &apos;t it be better if you only have a language that &apos;s not better ? so I &apos;m going to say that this is the only language Yoruba or 粤语 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll notice that you don &apos;t speak its native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race ethnic loop loop give you a rough and make you personally feel are lose civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I told you a different way of living “ ” I mentioned ” “ different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 Northwest Bala Caesar La areas that they &apos;re called 蚺 of a race because they believe that they &apos;re from the fabled 米尔克 coming out of the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t distinguish between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 so in their 天穹 with no difference in the forest canopy 
they say , a strange language and follow some rules 通婚 异族 通婚 linguistics . it &apos;s called a people to engage with the marriage of different languages . 
this is based on the historical lineage mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
when I was working with the genocide in Ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 tribals is one of the most amazing race in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
1957 missionaries five years to approach them , but that person made a fatal mistake . 
they get in the next eight to 10 十张 pictures of them as we think it &apos;s kind of , but they don &apos;t expect to live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional who &apos;d never seen before . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images being just flip through these people who are trying to find the person , but they found nothing . and they thought it was a call to Devil cards , so they use with this missionary 戮 five died . 
more of that is not only external 华拉尼 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is dying by their own 戮 dead people . 
we investigate some 一个八代 宗谱 两例 natural causes , we found only 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the same old being able to go to wood and that he 送终 戮 die for him . 
the other hand , they have astonishing forest 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell the predator 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I used to take on a fantastic job at Harvard professor , I asked me if I was interested in Haiti , to go to a secret club that &apos;s 杜华利 Haiti president and his regime for high base of the professors allow me to go there and access to make a 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand the way I have to figure out what this mysterious religious voodoo taught how voodoo teach isn &apos;t something that is the magic of the dark . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the world &apos;s major religions give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam Buddhist and other things that religions . 
there &apos;s a continent still forgotten many sub-Saharan Africa , not a religious person that is not right in these regions of the great famine nomadic people around the world to their faiths to teach and voodoo there &apos;s the essence of this stuff . 
voodoo unique about it is living with a connection between them . 
living in the spirit . 
the rhythm can tap dances 大水 spiritual awakening of just replace living soul in this brief shining moment 侍僧成 for God . 
so voodoo who likes to say you go to church worship to call God . 
we were to be divine cathedral . 
you &apos;ve been really attached . why would hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach 侍僧 evident trance in a state of de-animation sudden burning branches but worse for wear when they enter the state of hyperactivity extreme , you &apos;ll see more startling fact that makes you feel resilience . 
when I was exposed to all the populations who live in Colombia north end of the mountains of 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the ancient species , the tyranny civilization them once conquered and takes over the place of Columbia plain since they go back to the mountains of an interconnected plain . 
on the globe in bloody ethnic continent that has never been to the Spaniards . 
and what they along with monk 续 would rule , but they 训诫 monk is very different . 
there are only three little 侍僧 when it was taken away from their families had gone into the darkness of the glacier with a rock bottom to stay in the hut 十八年 is two nine years of age , and it &apos;s a metaphor for 40,000 fetuses in utero during the 怀胎 in September . 
they like back into a minority 母腹 taught the values that maintain these values , and the relationship between the believers in the universe , we can call it the balance . 
until they age , that magic of the first time they ever saw daylight hut out on the ground that sunlight display mind-blowingly intricate beauty and majesty of a sudden , families that they had learned all abstract knowledge was an amazing honor rabbi . and the way up to me and see I used to teach you is true . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call myself lies call over , we are destroying the world . 
this intuition , the ability to create a very important . 
speaking of 土族 风土人情 residents and asking us to think about the royal Russell 野人 old-growth legends that an ideal racist Thoreau we think about these guys more than we close . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 wouldn &apos;t tolerate 思乡 of torture 
in malaria , the prevailing 阿斯玛 刺骨 Tibetan wetlands in the wind &apos;s not how much land , but they rely on this kind of rough terrain . now , just in the growth of creating miracles , it &apos;s not because they consciously aware of that , and with their sensitive intuition that the world of human consciousness , because naturally absorbs the essence . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can live for a child in the Andes adults grew up the mountain taught him 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them as they are completely different type of people with the environment and 生养 field has a different relationship , in Montana , one of them is just a bunch of rock that can be used to open 采石 mine . 
whether the mountain gods are segregated or just a bunch of 矿石 that it doesn &apos;t matter . 
this is like the relationship between the people with nature . 
in British Columbia where I grew up in the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to the forest was cut down . 
and that makes me a tribe , and one of my friends , they become two groups of people because they believe that these trees are the eyes of heaven 胡克神 and Myung 精灵 eat you in the north of the world in a bar mitzvah Hama Landscape on which they could be with these 精灵 
if you from this perspective , and you see these cultural and created a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different lifestyle . 
this is a picture of me this past August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
dead on the water and the wonderful thing is that it &apos;s not magic medicinal sex and is it the machining , it actually made up of two things with one hand , it &apos;s a 藤本植物 咔 啉 蓬 硷 β -- and then when you sit down with small amounts of focusing on one hand , it seems to me , you can see a blue smoke it to something called the coffee 九节 carpenter &apos;s from all the bush . 
this is a potent dopamine in the color of the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribes people from contain serotonin , plants extract nose and continuing with this thing . 
if you use a nose swallows the powder , you &apos;ll see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not distorted 荡然无存 instead . 
in fact , I was with my mentors Richard Evan shultes arguing about in the 1930s , my mentor in Mexico to find a magic mushrooms are very powerful effects of psychedelic I used to with his argument that you can &apos;t take these color dopamine belong psychedelic category then when you sit down , because when they &apos;re working on you play when you &apos;ve never experience psychedelic . 
but the color doesn &apos;t matter dopamine oral because they &apos;re going to be human organ of something called the single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
the color dopamine to oral substance , there &apos;s also going to change the dopamine oral 氧化酶 of any chemicals . 
what &apos;s interesting is that there is the 藤本植物 β 咔 啉 exactly -- clapping to suppress the dopamine agonists 氧化酶 of working with color so you everyone must ask yourself 
in the woods has : 00 species , where people can see these two in the form of plants can &apos;t relate to play together this incredible power of this as a biochemical experiments in the chemical composition of effect than all wearing cookie-cutter 之和 
ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments repeatedly measure it wrong . 
but if you ask is , they would say that will speak . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person found in the cane is they all die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to the hierarchy is how they say , I want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants are not understand me . 
I told you that if they said in the months of this 17 crop circle of every plant will pay different singing the Greek to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. from Harvard , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem that some of us , something that compassion indigenous 离群索居 enrich their lives , but as we develop these people in the world forward stepped back to the edge of history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , and one of the people who are not going to happen in the war , or its innovation and technology will remember in our time on earth constructively with the ecological diversity to mass destruction , or passively accept the situation now where is still not change . 
and all cultures have been influenced by the new way of life . 
this is not technology . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with interest , it &apos;s Indians and the horse and carriage to sit still lives in the United States . 
the threat race doesn &apos;t change intact donut or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
look at the world around us , you don &apos;t have a culture is destined to extinction of the original affluent energy raped during the power of people out of their 生养 made them feel uncomfortable for them and ceaseless energy 伯南 heartland of deforestation and forest Southeast Asia , 游民 of the Lakota tribe , they also free and roam and pick up the generations to live in the woods and now has 沦落 for 仆役 and prostitutes called water sediment you can see , it seems to put the heavy 罗族 half 南中国海 冲走 to live in Japan , where people are ready to go to sail cargo ship from the forest and cut down the circle of wood and Jamie tribes 亚诺马 there because they were found gold 
now , let &apos;s see mountains in Tibet recently I did a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide cultural destruction , which is the destruction of the crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of their praise strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with that . 
I met a young colleagues from China Northwest 成都市 go through 6 : 00 miles southeast of Tibet journey through to when I arrived in during during the time that I really understood what you &apos;ve heard about the statistics of truth in hidden during the Cultural Revolution 6 : 00 temple by the largest 120 million people were killed where backbone molecule . 
and this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
Chinese invasion immediately after he killed . 
his uncle and other believer displacement into Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
and he was only two years old , he puts his mother quietly in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended and by the 学习班 behavior . 
one day she has to be with Mau on the president of the 臂章 to being executed for seven years of a nation 劳教 . 
the pain of Tibet elusive human spirit bear redemption need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a world still need an 五彩缤纷 and diversity of the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead before he once said that she was most worried about is because we &apos;ve come into this kind of their native worldview not only are we going to see the human imagination into more 陕 隘 thinking community and someday we wake up one day will forget about the world has other possibilities . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 drained . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
新石器 entering the era of human agricultural revolution , we would like to these seeds 腊 Beijerinck by 萨满 poetry all over the rabbi . and we created a level of 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
and I think this brief history was enough to have the ability to solve the air for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we ask the world &apos;s cultures life means , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have a different possibilities : one of the species that are completely fully realize we have to make sure that all race and everything 昌盛 to live a life of prosperity . 
this photograph was taken in the northern part of the mountain 巴芬岛 I was with some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 the name of a man told me about his grandfather &apos;s legendary story . 
in 1950s Canada government doesn &apos;t do the Inuit , to build a sovereign nation , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to migrate grandfather . 
his family was worried about safety and all the weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the thick of God . 
their sleds across the street in North America caribou 鹿皮 packet of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he slept on the outside in his skin his seal 长裤 stool to peanuts shit faster fingers stiffen , he made it into a blades shape . 
and in this shit on the edge of the spitting 口水 blades , and then it became very frozen solid , who &apos;ve dealt with this dog knife . 
and then peel off the dog made out of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds condoms to make this other dog . don &apos;t that was put in a matter of manure on the knife . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , in the world for all indigenous 顽强 becomes real life . 
April 1999 Canada to an area the size of Texas and California than 之和 larger land returned back to the Inuit , 
I was our new home its name is Troy non-Inuit Le dimensions 
and this is one of their independence , where all the oceans control . 
this is a good state can make a difference to repair and its people . 
and I think that ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as the planet . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we have to be with National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe in India . 
we think and argue is not to convince others , but we think about it can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s good at telling the truth of our website , a click of the three of these five million pounds 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
we need to do is through a series of apartheid for the audience to tour takes us on a miracle of culture that they &apos;re going to see everything they can &apos;t stop , and we want his previous masterpieces pollen more inclusive and to bring these cultural anthropology at the heart of the world need variety of ways that we can actually live in a multicultural world for all the wisdom of all races could sinking into human well-being difference . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera Y arcas photosynth demos this stunning of years , we will watch this software that could change the way , using digital images from the pick static photosynth stunning photos , created a kind of vision , and we can navigate . 
blaise agueray photosynth arcas presentation . 
first , and I want to quickly show you some new technology , the basic research , which is a year ago , Microsoft acquired our company , and we for Microsoft with this technology , it &apos;s a software seadragon . seadragon environment , you can use it to 近景 or vision to browse the vastness of visualizing the data . 
we see there are many gigabits 千兆 bytes . and in our digital photographs , they can continue to zoom in , and the larger context to browse through them , and they could rearrange them . 
no matter how many of all the data sets , images and image how big itself , seadragon all have that kind of processing capability . 
so the images were mostly by digital cameras shoot , which is different , it is an image from the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it &apos;s not different , because the only limit system powerful factors are : you &apos;re using the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; desolate Dickens 山庄 , &quot; which is a chapter three . 
I &apos;m going to show you is that this is really text , images , we can do it , you see , this is really text , not the picture . 
maybe it would be a way to read a book . 
but I wouldn &apos;t recommend it . 
and here &apos;s one more example , this is an The Guardian . 
every did here is one of the opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine version of it involves making multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy reading . 
we got a small change this issues in The Guardian on it . 
we make them up a high-resolution picture -- advertising than you see this kind of a normal commercial high resolution , the picture of a lot of extra life into the content . 
if you want to see the car , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
in this way to avoid the actual use of the screen . 
we hope that this technology can reduce the window to be thrown like garbage . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps and one of the applications . 
and yet , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these were just at NASA geospatial images . 
we have to deal with a layer of the road map . 
now , let &apos;s put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different technologies . 
one is seadragon , and the other , from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely that computer vision research findings . the research also got Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski transcribe . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied , it &apos;s based on the seadragon technology building . 
you can see here , we can easily picture of multiple ways to do , is able to look for images going at a more nuanced and resolution to experience . 
well , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very significant . 
computer vision algorithms are going to make those pictures together , so you can get these pictures are real space , and we &apos;re in this room took these pictures -- these are the Rockies , in Canada La Grou : a near vacuum grassi 西湖 and lakes of -- all these pictures were taken in here . so you can see here is the hope of elements was larger context imaging , or in space , and these things are correlated . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have more time to mapping the environment . 
there are many examples of this place it . 
and let &apos;s take a look at last summer , and we use one of those databases noah photosynth models of what the building , and I think it &apos;s definitely the technology of our most 抢眼 . it &apos;s not just like we on the web , showing that simple . 
mainly because we build websites , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
here is the Flickr website images of Paris Notre Dame . you can do is , Flickr “ site in Paris Notre Dame ” and you can see a lot of pictures , including the photograph alleys , etc . , all of those orange color represents a cone to build models . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this by 串联 in space . 
and then we can so easily to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
by this , it was exhilarating . 
I think you can see from these images , a lot of the camera , from the mobile phone camera into a single backwards . so a lot of different quality , in this environment , were put together . 
let me get some pretty strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors 大头 contains the photos , etc . 
I remember here is a series of photos -- ah , over here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can work in the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
here &apos;s the point that we can work with the community . we can learn from each person is going to get everyone to varied climates memory , collect together to build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined , is to create a much more than just take all of them . 
this model menacing , what is the whole planet . 
and it &apos;s Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
pictures of , you will be in the tag . 
if people are willing to work in all these Notre Dame 圣贤 tags that went on , who are these pictures , then we went to Notre Dame rich , and then , we can , in this picture as a point , you enter this space , this by many pictures of virtual worlds , to build a model , across all across the user interface . 
of course , this is another precious product is a very rich model -- this is interesting Earth every corner of the landscape . these landscapes , not just in the air and satellite images , but the real people pressing the shutter 一刻所 collection of the collective memory . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right now , you &apos;ll be in the years to come from a global icon 接合 together ? 
yeah . the software is really significant to explore . 
it builds up in this middle hypertext . 
this process is entirely 接合 based on the content . 
even more exciting is that picture of text semantic contains information . 
for example , you go on a picture , type , on the web to have a lot of with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , with your picture ? 
and so these semantic information , connectivity and the capacity to be huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist 施瓦茨 for Western society in the center of a credo -- the freedom to choose to launch . in 施瓦茨 seems more options that we have more freedom , and that makes us paralyzed , and they didn &apos;t make you feel more enjoyable will bring more unsatisfying . 
Barry 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I think I &apos;m here to talk about the book of content hopefully it and you &apos;ve already heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know how much of what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I think one of their faith . 
what kind of creed ? 
this whole industrial 笃信 Western society , not by a credo . 
this creed it : if we allow people to get the welfare state , its way is to maximize that individual liberty . 
why is this thing in the freedom to itself is the good and valuable , for people need . 
and once you have the freedom , each of us can 做主 with all the way the welfare . you don &apos;t get people to for 做主 . 
the freedom to make a big enough to do is increase selective . 
people , more and more freedom , freedom , getting more and more welfare . 
I think , the idea , like so that when you add it to the first time that we are firmly rooted in that nobody would have to admit to that question . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my local a supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
I was a supermarket 175种 pronouncement salad ingredients , which is not the first 10 different sign would have specialized 榨 olive oil and vinegar 12 balsamic grapes 选购 meritocracy , if you happen to be that there are no 175种 salad with your taste , that you can use them hook and a large number of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , this is a supermarket . 
and you turn out to be a pop-up stores one configuration that includes a stereo system -- and CDs blah , blah , a 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system that &apos;s a lot more . 
with this store components that you can have a combination of the last 650万种 three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t say it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in a business , I &apos;m talking about communication . 
when I was a kid , you want to refer to phone service , Maya Bell , you have to go , just this one company . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
often what happens is that the phone to die , they would not bad . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
yet we have almost infinite variety of mobile phone , especially that . exactly . 
these are the future of mobile phones . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , a nose cutting hair and French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store seen , don &apos;t worry , . pretty soon , you &apos;ll see . 
this is the outcome , people running into shops asking : you have a conversation with so many function ? 
you think about it , answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now you can &apos;t buy a not so many things stem cell phones . 
again , in the lives of more than others shopping for us , this effect on the same choice explosion . 
the health care in the United States , it &apos;s not about that , you go to the doctor , so they tell you how to do era . 
instead , you get the doctor , they would say to you : we can use cure nail 乙 , you can use it . 
and so forth and make a solution nail risk . 
and so forth and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” I do ? 
they say it and nail has these effects and risk , 乙 has the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
you can then ask : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” ? 
the psychiatrist says , but I &apos;m not “ ” you . 
as a result of patients municipalities “ . ” It feels pretty good . it is to make decisions and the bear responsibility from an idea what to do -- I mean , to a doctor 转嫁 treatments , and we &apos;re going to require , not here to make decisions in the state of people , who is the patient . 
now the prescription for pharmaceutical ad all over the place , so that the ordinary people around you and me . if you think about it , and said , we just can &apos;t buy directly to counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they wanted us to look at the ad after the next morning , go to your doctor , the doctor to call on a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our gender identity and have a choice . just like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we could get to the indelibly their gender . 
this is every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a kind of women and men are the decision . 
in a marriage family aspects , in the last everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age for granted , then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who are married , rather than when we got married later , it &apos;s not what it does . 
and now , this whole thing could pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart magnificant students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework for almost one . 
it &apos;s not because they were dumb , and the student -- and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so hardworking . 
now the reason is their brains are filled with all sorts of things , and I asked myself : what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and when I was trying to first child , and I knew things ? 
this is 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they do not do is I assign homework , whether they were in my class pick what grades . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology allows us to any one time , in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but in restaurants , this is really a place to WiFi , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
and we work with these incredible that we have the freedom to choose where we had to choose to make decisions , again , again , again , and now to work and to break moved . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 when the mobile , another 裤兜 in pretend BlackBerry blackberry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even if they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the rivals for children and ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick up the phone ? 
go back to the email or not ? I should write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself , you don &apos;t think the answer is kids think that this ball game experience is still be severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big , substance or lifestyle , lifestyle choice is . 
we live in the world . 
in other words , choice is still there , but not to have nothing to choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what &apos;s really good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know the . so let me tell you it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s kind of an oxymoron , though , it &apos;s not going to bring us , but inside , is we numb . 
so many choices that people have found a very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a peer-to-peer pension plan to invest in terms of research . 
a colleague of mine came in contact with vanguard investment , vanguard is a huge helps fund company , with about a million employees , two , 000多个 office . 
her surveyed is when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every 10 or more to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to offer 50种 fund , you give people than five , 10 has declined . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it was even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s halide tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you &apos;ll never will . 
we know this actually means , when people the chance to be only just use dog food 充饥 drawn , because they don &apos;t have enough money to the future , and make decisions , because it &apos;s so hard to even employer , given that a very strong symmetrical for a grant are not use quit . 
don &apos;t join the plan for a year , they make up 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide are obsessed with this . 
so , it &apos;s too many choices are paralyzed . 
it makes our world looks like this . and in this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose that helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
and it &apos;s the first -- so negative impact on . and here &apos;s the second , even if I go through trying to overcome rigid and paralysis and finally made a good decisions , about our own decisions and we can choose sexual 少时 decisions more content . 
there are a few reasons . 
one is , with so many salad ingredients species , if you bought a , think about , you &apos;re very easy to imagine if you pick another . and what happens ? this idea of a massive influx and choose your decision that you have to feel regret , which makes you feel remorse for your choice , happiness be called , even though it was a very good thing to do . 
choice , more easily inexplicably for something to feel regret . this is one of them , I &apos;m not happy with their choice . 
and second , is what economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a enough , we see something depends on the values that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there are lots of options , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you gave up the choice in many ways , and that makes you like to think that you see the 美中不足 . 
for example -- and shows cartoons , and if you are not in New York , I have a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think about that . 
look at those two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have it . 
and this is better than that , right ? it thinking “ huh , really bad , right now is ” “ ” August . 
“ Manhattan of your neighbors are not ” at home . 
I &apos;m going to be “ back then are able to stop in my own ” door . 
and two weeks , he was such an idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the right on the opportunity . 
“ opportunity cost ” always has enabled us to make decisions that are good enough , even if it actually quite remarkable . 
we have the option in these choices , the more exciting thing is , the last , these things are opportunity cost . 
that &apos;s another example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but it is , one of them , when you choose to do something , and then you have chosen not to do other things . 
the other thing you tend to have a lot to decrease , and you &apos;re doing , appeal to you . 
and third , through expectations . 
and at one time I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the past , jeans is that , you buy a car , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long time , enough to be washed so many times , get 凑合 pants . 
so , in the years old , I finally street to buy the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and said , you have to type , the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
in front of his buttons . it &apos;s going to pull unlocked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
to the fastest grinds them ? 
and that &apos;s the back of his mouth ? 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw nearly fall , when I got over , and I said , I &apos;m “ that was only one ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 all these damn jeans , finally , in fact , I took a I never really 合身 pants out the door . 
I did not really wrong . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? why that I actually wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , the reason is because there are so many , I would choose for a jeans exactly what you would expect to be greatly good warmer . 
I was very low expectations . when a jeans is so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at best , and it &apos;s an economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really nice , but it isn &apos;t perfect . 
so I had to take me and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expected of me , this becomes disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together , in addition to raise awareness for exactly how good things to the outside it didn &apos;t expect people with many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , there &apos;s nobody understood this when they are . because if you know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it was coming in all this stuff is really bad for everything better than now . 
the reason is , as a way that is not good people could experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , our civic life in the industrialized world , it for granted , for everything you hoped it not only than you would expect . 
what you will be no surprise , because what you expect me than the sky . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so it , I think , let &apos;s take a little bit of time , I married my wife , and she was a perfect wife . 
I don &apos;t have the 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
and finally , buy a 合身 jeans and no one is that when the store , which you can buy , you can feel happy , want to know why , this imperative is who ? the answer was clear . the world is responsible . what do you have to do ? 
now there are hundreds of jeans in store for you , you bought a pair of back and think unsatisfying , and you ask , who &apos;s responsibility ? 
now obviously the answer is : you . 
you can do better . 
and the girl with hundreds of jeans , you have no excuse have gotten . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to achieve results good they are so disappointed , to decide -- to blame myself . 
in our past this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world now in clinical explosive growth is depressed . 
I believe that if the suicide explosive growth and an important , not the only , but it &apos;s important factor , which is all of those disappointing . why is the standard is too high . when they have to explain these experiences what &apos;s going on , they think it &apos;s their own before . 
and the net effect is that although objectively we do better than ever before , but it doesn &apos;t look like from the front . 
I remind you . 
this led to the well-being of principles , we think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . it &apos;s not right . 
there &apos;s no doubt have no choice , but can &apos;t abandon picture choose more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond our ’ ‘ choose the richest and the key value . 
I said . here is a policy question , we have a policy question is , for our industrial society , is so many choices matter enormously rich . 
the world , and lots of places , at least , we heard a handful of , where it &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies on a particular problem . 
Sr : 里维特 yesterday , said that , incredible indignant , the question is , we make those expensive and to operate the car seat 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is this expensive and complicated choice to not just 于事无补 . 
they are actually going to bring us . 
they actually makes us not in . 
and if we had to create this society and the system to commit to get out of the people who are not enough to go out of choice , not only the lives of people there can be improved , our own lives is also improved for . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
product redistribution to everybody , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us out of a pandemic . 
the end , you should look at this cartoon , a guy standing on the positions , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
I &apos;ll tell you that in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting , that &apos;s reading . 
but I want to feel more clearly this fish must know something about it . 
because the truth , if you want everything becomes possible to break the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want everything becomes possible to break the fish , you reduce the happiness . 
you have increased was paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
in this fish -- and why , for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but that didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish , which means that suffering , perhaps , put disaster . 
thank you very much . 
we can “ from the digital world in creating new life ? ” Craig Venter . he said , the answer is “ can ” and pretty soon , he discusses his latest research and promises very soon we &apos;ll have created the ability to activate pair chromosome . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and discover the genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to do from the digital code to a new design biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I guess many biologists continued to try to understand in at different levels . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now we &apos;ve spent the last 20 years , when we go to sequence human genomes in the world from analog in biology , computer analysis September the digital world . 
now , we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world will create a new life ? 
this is a map of the genetic sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome to make it in the lab self-replication . and we &apos;re trying to figure out whether we could find a smaller genome . 
we have to separate out 一百组 500组 genes that we have in front of these . 
but when we look at its metabolism , this is actually relatively simple relative to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple , but when we look at all these things that we can separate out at the genome , it &apos;s hard to believe that they can create a living cell . 
so , we think the only way to continue studying these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its component to continue to ask the basic problem . 
so we started to walk along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , and by the way , just some topless notions of chemicals . 
our digital lives in an exponential rate and speed . 
we write the genetic code , the ability to extremely slow progress , but also in the increasing . and what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact after several steps . when we did before , so the first trial conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
we have 十几万台 devices are making small pieces of DNA , in about 30 to 50 character , and this is a step back , make a long time , the more you have a lot of mistakes . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first attempt to Phi X 174 , from the genome and phage digital information . 
a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed this gene , and it &apos;s wrong with , say , a symbol of DNA . 
and the most exciting period is when we don &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , building a viral particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative HIV-infected . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , I think that they have a model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
but we want to expand . we want to make the entire bacterial chromosomes , a far more than 10,000 580 , length of the genetic code . we think is probably the size of a virus ” “ box , make them so that we can change these ” “ box to understand a living cell components is the actual ? 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that those numbers to accurate information . 
when we first to see this in 1995 , for the gene sequencing is about a fundamental mistake per 10,000 . 
in fact , we found , in order to 30 , the average is wrong . if we use the genetic sequence , which would never have turned on . 
design was part of the design of 50 symbol than the other 50 symbol of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they get together . 
and we design the distinctive parts . 
you &apos;ve probably heard about in which we 水印 . 
consider the genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
so far 三联 modestly -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids amino acids , such that each have a marked . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences words and ideas . 
and initially , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we don &apos;t use it for a poem . 
and we designed that can use the bias enzyme which cuts . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from 70 length of time to put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time and pull out into the merger fragmented , at the time . 
at every stage , we put the result of that we can give them precise , because we wanted to create a very reliable . you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
it &apos;s like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when those big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 basic when they &apos;re hard to keep on E. coil in longer . in trying to make the modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology to repair , using DNA , and it takes time together 
here &apos;s an example of microbes called resistant to withstand 三百万度 球菌 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , its chromosomes in different places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it has to go back and combinations of before . 
we can do that , there are thousands of microbes . 
it can totally out of water . they can live in a vacuum 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , in a new and water . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a group of us take this molecule . these microscopic images through the process , which is just the way and put it into yeast right after we design . yeast automatically and aggregates . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than the genetic code 580000 character . it &apos;s held by humans setting the structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t 10-point font distance to the printed 142页 . and you need to print the genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously a very simple dealing with a virus that &apos;s much more complicated . 
we deal with this kind of like that and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in a cell that &apos;s what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they 连成 one with the cells , but we also understand that we can do a complete the chromosome from transplanting cells to another one of the cell and activate it . 
we go from a population of microbes extract chromosomes , basically , that &apos;s the difference between humans and mice . we added a new set of genes that we can choose those chromosomes . we use them to get rid of the enzyme , from all the proteins when we put it into the cells of a very amazing happens when you should be like we &apos;re making fantastic images -- . 
new release into cells . 
in fact , we thought that just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process was designed some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosomes species or from elsewhere in the third side of the chromosomes , one second of the thousands and thousands of new feature to its own . 
people were held in the process of evolution and that &apos;s a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of many organisms . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called restriction enzymes are digesting the DNA . 
the chromosome out of the cell and not without this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
they do it , and recognize the other chromosome is no matter , it is to digest , finally , we have a new have DNA . 
we put it into a gene causing blue . 
in very short period of time , all the species that we were totally and completely disappeared into a new species , we put the new software ” “ cells . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , effectively , we will implant . 
this may seem like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do this ? 
I think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
we are going to be in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people on each of us from 1946 . you know ; in the next 40 years , they become the four . 
we &apos;re for 65亿 of people , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
which nine billion people that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 coal , oil , which is a day . 10 . 
when we try to think about this creature program or no substitute for its application , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is the material of the world &apos;s CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world , there &apos;s a contains approximately 两千万组 genetic database , and I like to see them as the future of design components . 
electrical industry about components to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now , our main limit from reality in biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because it creates what we call the mixing chromosomes ” “ group of very synthetic . 
what we have the ability to build a robot that allows us to create a million chromosomes a day . 
when you &apos;re thinking about processed this 两千万组 different genes , and we tried to optimize the steps that 制剂 辛烷 or create drugs , and the new vaccine , we can change , even a small team , can do better than the last 20 years of science had done more molecular biology . 
and it &apos;s only criteria . we can choose to live lives of ability to choose , or chemical production in the entire fuel , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the whole thing is that we actually sit at work in the computer to actually design species . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you saw recently corn ethanol is going into a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value of fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
but we think of biology can make a huge impact it can &apos;t grow food . it can use to limit to is that if we can start using CO2 as its material . again , we &apos;re designing for the new cells that make this a viable . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide -- is one way of doing that . 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a microbial , 1996 by about them . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it put CO2 into the methane hydrogen molecules of its energy source . 
we were looking at whether we can put their collections of two , very convenient , then they can be introduced into processing , fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we probably can increase in life ? &quot; &quot; is a fundamental problem . 
we have with the whole oil industry , the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there might be a major ? pollution-free . 
and we are using the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you can all of this flu , we &apos;re always going on a year and lack of money in the context of when the vaccine . 
I think it would be expected to change the mixing vaccine manufacturing . 
this is the future might change the situation , along with the evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last belong and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better farther away from human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure we get a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do that . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox shares some which super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
last year at TED I introduced the LHC . 
and I said to update it back to talk about the machines running . 
and here it is , if you didn &apos;t come from last year , the LHC is in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in reinventing the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began of this state . 
so much more ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we &apos;re using them for some mini the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas of the process of building magnificent scale to see the big vision . 
last September 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is an atlas photos of the site . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of the LHC all along the way we plan with the LHC particles , in part of a heat 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see that in September 10th of a scene , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know it &apos;s got this 满堂喝彩 -- when people see if I go to Google icons like this . 
this suggests that we work on this with the culture of science as it were . 
but about a week later , we came up with a machine that does to the main 导线 导线 about -- the gold . 
these 导线 conduction 安培 currents while they all machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say , these wires “ impossible ” too narrow . 
they can do because when it gets very little superconducting 导线 them . 
so at minus 271摄氏度 below the planet in the space of these 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a technical installation 接点 there is a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it a little bit of a sudden they conduction 安培 current by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because those magnets material they move it weighs about a mile constructed . 
we have about 50 magnets impaired . 
to put them unloaded , which has done . 
we gave them joy , fix . 
now , they come back into the ground . 
in about three to refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data and continue our mission to figure out the basic units . 
now obviously , there are about to crash so cutting-edge science and engineering , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but the fact that the pursuit of our projects , which is the value of the LHC . 
and I want to a British scientists 复述 戴维翰 warren , and I remember him as an apprentice meaningless experiment defense -- his master &apos;s Michael 法拉 chapter -- said , for the human brain development , there &apos;s nothing more than the dangerous idea : think we have to understand the mysteries in science as well have everything we &apos;ve been so 全胜 stop to explore new . 
thank you . 
for those incredibly great social often contemporary art , to start with a creator itself , for people to genius beyond what &apos;s extraordinary . Elizabeth Gilbert , for this to explore and thinking , opens up for creating genius 独到 : think of some guy &apos;s genius “ ” , than he or she graduated in creativity “ genius ” . in this entertaining and personal talk , and full color 令人感动 inspiration . 
Elizabeth Gilbert 呵护 creativity , about creativity and reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing , not just my career , even with the love of my life obsessed with 
I &apos;m a writer , writing , not just my career , even with the love of my life obsessed with 
I &apos;m a writer , writing , not just my career , even with the love of my life obsessed with 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently in my life , I was working in a particular event , however , recently in my life working in a special events that happened that I have to rethink me with my work . 
this particular event was : my most recent book published in The 回忆录 and food and pray , love &quot; that particular event was : my most recent book published in The 回忆录 and food and pray , &quot; I love those very generic pieces make a difference somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller . 
it turns out , and no matter where I think , people all my life as a result , no matter where I now know , people think that my life . 
so , really , is completely , saved , play 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very anxious , came to me and said , you can &apos;t be afraid “ ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
you don &apos;t “ . would you like this , and I &apos;ve always written by a love of that work ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this , and I &apos;ve always written by a love of that work ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this , and I &apos;ve always written by a love of that work ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this life forever , but that was written by a love of ” work ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
my life would be very difficult , but luckily , I remembered writer 20 years ago , I decided that day would be very difficult , but luckily , I came to 20 years ago , writer that I was a teenager , I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t worried that may not work ? 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t worried that may not work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid to take you on the bearing down upon ? 
you don &apos;t work for the rest of it there ? you not afraid to try it was a lifelong ? you end up in her broken dreaming , filled with despair die in the pain you end up in her broken dreaming , filled with despair die in the center . 
you end up in her broken dreaming , filled with despair die in the self , I was always get questioning , etc . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , this kind of scary everything else today . 
yes , this kind of scary everything else today . 
well beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that many people suspect that beyond that , I &apos;m afraid not many people think . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I was wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I was wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is a cerebral idea ? 
people fear for their own destiny job ? this logic ? people fear for their own destiny job ? this logic ? 
creative work is the thing that makes us for sanity worry about the creative work ? what &apos;s the thing that makes us for each other about the sanity of it ? other industries that &apos;s not a break , right ? 
for example , my dad was an engineer chemistry in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he was a chemical engineer in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he was a chemical engineers . 
nobody says : “ John , working with a chemical bottlenecks ” ? ? 
this could never have asked . 
of course , 平心而论 chemical engineers , it just doesn &apos;t in the last few centuries , by addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last few centuries , by addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
not in the last few centuries , by addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 down the writer , and we actually have that kind of reputation , not only the writers , variety of creative people seem to have emotions , very violent 恶名 not only the writers , variety of creative people seem to have very violent 恶名 emotion . 
just look at the early last century , different areas with great geniuses 英年早逝 case for early last century , looking at different areas with great geniuses 英年早逝 case is often can &apos;t die of suicide . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t reveal their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t reveal their talent . 
Noam 曼梅 , died in the last one interview I said , “ every one of the 蚕食 ” part of me . 
in your life &apos;s work , that was an aggressive . 
but we wanted to 视若无睹 story , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 . but we wanted to 视若无睹 story , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 and somehow , people are totally accepted it and internalize . that &apos;s the idea : creativity and suffering , creating art that will eventually lead to extreme 苦闷 , this idea is that creativity and suffering , creating art that will eventually lead to extreme 苦闷 
I want to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? I &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? 
you think this sentiment ? no problem , even a little bit further away at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in species . 
this is not only 可憎 , and awful , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 , and awful , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century 可憎 , and it &apos;s not only that , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century . 
I think we encourage all the great geniuses live there will be . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I myself , believed that matter to me , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially at the moment in my career . 
you see , I was a young man , to 40 years old , you know , I was young , 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and probably , from this moment , I write a piece of every will be used to , and I was an incredibly tragic event in a big on definitions comparing , isn &apos;t it ? will be used to , and I was an incredibly tragic event in a big on definitions comparing , right ? 
and frankly , we have to look at the time , I made friends that out loud , right , potentially , in my biggest successes is over . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of ideas . 
is this idea that makes you took a drink 大清早 drank -- not to the way , is this idea that makes you took a 大清早 drank -- had no way back . I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to do what I want to carry on with my loves of writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to carry on with my loves of writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deeper , for me to keep writing , I had to create some psychological by the way to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protection . 
I have to do it in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from writing is extremely anxiety , and I work for responses from the anxious . 
a year ago , I look around , you can see the pattern in history , and look at different cultures around looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and look at different cultures around looking for a year ago , I can see the pattern in history , looking at different cultures , to see if they have better , more than our intellectual ideas to help 艺术工作者 handle art , what &apos;s inside of emotional risk to help 艺术工作者 handle art , what &apos;s inside of emotions . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greeks and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;re going to go back to the last question . 
that in Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient Greek and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient Greek and Ancient Rome that people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks widely known with this kind of creative 精灵 as stewards for “ ” 
and people often think Socrates stewards for that one , from a distance to give him to think that general wisdom and Socrates stewards for that one , from a distance to give it intelligence . 
the people who have similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” 
this view of a little bit , because the Romans ” “ geniuses don &apos;t think is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful , because the Romans ” “ geniuses don &apos;t think is a particularly intelligent people . 
they think is a wonderful ” “ genius of the sacred and they even think “ genius ” living in the walls of the artist studios , like little 精灵 than they consider “ genius ” living in the walls of the artist studios , like little 精灵 than they would come quietly , invisible to help artist delivers on work , and they would come 成败 quietly , invisible to help artist delivers that piece 成败 . 
it &apos;s amazing , that &apos;s where I was looking at this safe distance from work is to make people affected by mental 成败 . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by the artist that and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic ancient artists from this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work is so great that can &apos;t quite attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass ” “ genius of the project . 
if you work a terrible , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is a Western in the last for a long time about creativity . 
and that &apos;s coming , everything changed , and people had a great idea , and that &apos;s coming , everything changed , and people had a big idea : “ , let &apos;s take the human heart , in the universe beyond the gods mysterious and unknown ” “ , let &apos;s take the human heart , in the universe beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown ” space that never leave the gremlin who will deliver sacred . 
this is the beginning of a rational humanism , people start to believe that all creativity comes from human beings . this is the beginning of a rational humanism , people start to believe that all stems from human creativity , individual itself , which is rational humanism , people started to believe in the beginning of creativity that completely itself from human beings . 
the first time ever , people will be a genius ” “ artists called , rather than having a “ ” history , talented people first put some artists called ” “ genius , rather than having a “ ” history , talented people first put some artists called ” “ genius , rather than having a ” “ brilliant . 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
for one person , a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred , creativity and unknown , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred , creativity and unknown , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred , creativity , more of these things , and with the demand for fishes , he &apos;s like a swallow , the sun , which was fragile one-nth , huge responsibility . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , which was fragile one-nth , huge responsibility . 
this was completely down one &apos;s perception , and to make an individual . completely down to this one &apos;s perception , and for the immense personal expression . 
I think is this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists , I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artist . 
if that &apos;s what I thought it was then the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go to more ancient past , to see them for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go to more ancient past , to see them for human creativity and understanding ? 
may not work . 
we can &apos;t use a short 18-minute talk that incorporate 500多年 off the human mind , the reason we can &apos;t use a short 18-minute talk , off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
and maybe in the audience today , they are grounded in evidence that suggests that some scientific questioning , and maybe in the audience today , they are grounded in evidence that people can ask this question of science 批驳 fairy 精灵 following artists , the access to work on this kind of ridiculous idea water 批驳 fairy 精灵 following artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous . 
maybe I could not convince you agree with me . 
but my point is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but , I mean , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but my point is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
that &apos;s all kinds of uncertainty in theory , the creative process 精灵 theory and I &apos;ve heard all other theories or as fair and to the same irrational 精灵 theory and I &apos;ve heard all other theories , or as fair and irrational . 
this process , for any of you who &apos;ve tried to make sure you all sitting there in that experience will know I don &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s just beyond common 
for example , I met the great American poet bowhead silk . 斯通 bowhead silk 九十多岁 , she has been a poet and she said she was growing up in Virginia , in a life of the things that she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance . 
like this on the breath of emptying down at her . 
she can touch it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she can touch it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with only one thing is to really “ dashed across ” 
she goes home dashed across , it will go chase dashed across her face , and she would go home , it will go chase down at her , she explained to find the pen and paper , and in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , write things on paper , she explained to find a pen and paper , in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , write things on paper , she explained to find a pen and paper , in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , write things on paper 
sometimes she wasn &apos;t fast enough , she &apos;s crazy , running , there &apos;s home , and it has been Pentium , so she would miss it , she &apos;s crazy , don &apos;t run home , and it has Pentium about it , and she would miss it , and she said it will continue to mass-produce swimming , find a poet ” “ down , and she said it will continue to mass-produce swimming , looking for ” “ next poet . 
in other , it &apos;s called me the most amazing part : at some point , this is called me the most amazing part : sometimes she said she are almost 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running back home and finding the pen and paper , and it will go through her , she was going through the creation and grabbed a pen and the poem is going to go through her , she was going through it , it doesn &apos;t catch up and she &apos;s on the other hand , it grabs the tail , and she &apos;s on the other hand , grab that poem tails . 
and she &apos;s on the other hand , it grabs the tail , to get back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is upside down and ordered them , from the beginning , the last word go by , until after the first words . 
except that sequence was upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , until after the first word I heard her story , I was like , this is incredible , and my creative process the same time , I &apos;ve heard her story , I was like , this is incredible , and I , the creative process . 
I heard her story , I was like , this is incredible , and my creative process , it &apos;s not me ! of course , the process of all , I &apos;m not a pipe , and my job more like a so bad . 
of course , it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my works more like a day , so I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work every day , I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get devoted to work . 
but even 古板 , sometimes I get incredible inadvertently inspired 古板 , but even as I sometimes have inspired by accident . 
in many of you may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , I don &apos;t know where to go through the inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what was going on here ? 
we &apos;re in how to think about it , not rational ? we have lost in how to think about it , don &apos;t have lost rational ? 
what I knew contemporary artists , this problem with the best musicians 汤姆威兹 is what I knew contemporary artists , to deal with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 a few years ago , I was a magazine his job interview , when we talk about this issue . 
a few years ago , I was a magazine his job interview , when we talk about this issue , Tom &apos;s or creative stress of modern artists or Tom &apos;s typical of the stress of modern artist delivers a typical spend time , he has been trying to control , management and run that controlled the inspiration spend time , he has been trying to control , management and run that controlled the inspiration spend time , he has been trying to control , management and run that you can &apos;t see the inspiration . 
but the older disease , and he becomes 敛 沉静 within a day , he told me , he in Los Angeles on Highway drive , this happened that changed his life he told me , day in Los Angeles on Highway drove him , and had changed his life . 
he &apos;s accelerating forward , he suddenly , half heard a little bit of the melody ♪ ♪ forward , and he is accelerating , half heard a little bit of the melodies and rhythms intractable ♪ ♪ invading his mind , like inspiration temporary unpredictable violin , and this melody intractable tempting to his mind , like inspiration temporary , unpredictable and attractive his violin badly to capture it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder pen and paper 
he was eager to capture it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t pen and paper , there are a tape recorder , and he wanted to capture it , but there was no way , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder pen and paper 
he feels kind of creative anxiety and get “ in his body , I was going to lose the inspiration , and this piece will not go 永世 阴魂 ” “ tortured me , I &apos;m going to lose the inspiration , and this piece will 永世 阴魂 afraid to tortured me ” 
no , I &apos;m “ I couldn &apos;t do ” 
suddenly , he had to go on a multimillionaire panic and impatience emotions , and do something unusual . 
suddenly , he had to go on a multimillionaire panic and impatience emotions , and does a remarkable things suddenly , he had to go on a multimillionaire panic and impatience emotions , and do something unusual . 
he looked up to the sky , it says , “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , I was driving ? ” he looked up to the sky , it says , “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , I &apos;m ” driving ? 
he looked up to the sky , it says , “ sorry , you can &apos;t see , I was driving ? ” I looked like immediately you can get a piece of ? 
if you really want in the world , and pick the right time , I come in handy , if you really want in the world , and pick the right time and again , in my convenience . 
or , you can today to harassment , go find somebody to 莱昂纳德 / 科恩 
or , you can today to harassment , go find somebody to 莱昂纳德 / 科恩 
since that happened , Tom changed the creative process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , he still is completely dark . 
but when he put creation genius peel away from themselves , along with the process of anxiety also transform the creative genius , but when he turned out to pull itself , along with the process of anxiety are going to transform the inspiration is the self , just a pain in trouble , and it was liberated 倒像 原处 put back , and he realized he doesn &apos;t have to take inspiration from within , tortures itself . 
he can inspiration and this is an unknown between bizarre and wondrous and strange relationship to his inspiration and this is an unknown between bizarre and wondrous and strange relationship that &apos;s a beyond ourselves . 
this story pernicious and changing the way my work , this transformation has saved me this story pernicious and changing the way my work , this transformation has saved me again . 
it was written in the food and pray , love when I was a 无底洞 anxiety of despair , which is on the food and pray , love when I was a kind of anxiety and depression 无底洞 effort , but not despair 低潮 inspiration state and then gradually you think this is going to be a total failure to be the worst of the book . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I began to think I should give up wrote this book . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I began to think I should give up wrote this book . 
and then I remembered for the day , Tom shouting that , and then I tried to try and then I remembered for the day , Tom shouting that , and then I tried to 
I looked up from the manuscript , to an empty room in the corner from manuscript that I looked up to one of the room . 
and then loudly “ you announce , this guy , give me listen ” “ 咱 both know , if this book , it &apos;s not a person is not my fault , isn &apos;t it ? ” “ 咱 both know , if this book , it &apos;s not my fault , one ” isn &apos;t it ? 
“ because you can see , I &apos;ve put all of them kept ” “ because you can see , I have no effort put towards ” reservation . 
“ if you want this book is getting better , it &apos;s now your turn that part of them , do you ” work . 
“ not to help , that you can see the ghost ” . &quot; 
&quot; I &apos;m going to continue to write down , because it &apos;s my job . &quot; 
I hope that the historical record 尽责 : I had to hold my jobs perhaps today , I hope that the historical record and 尽责 to hold my jobs . 
I hope that the historical record 尽责 : I had to hold my jobs because because this is the last few centuries ago in the North Africa &apos;s deserts , people will 月色 down in front of the sacred party centuries ago we started in the North Africa &apos;s deserts , people will 月色 down in front of the sacred we party until the last several hours . 
the performance , wonderful , because they are a great professional dancer who show a wonderful , because they are a great professional dancer . 
occasionally , although very rare , but actually happens one dancers to overwhelm the transcendent 出世 . 
you know , I should say that because you &apos;ve all seen at some point , like that . 
it seems , time stops dancers through time , it seems to be stopped , across the dancers like he did . and before the 1000场 shows that there is no difference , but everything was amazingly , together . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , his life in the light from the bottom of light . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , his life , from the inside of the light from the bottom of the light and shine by sacred fire . 
people , to know what it is , they can name it , that people know exactly what it is , they can name it . 
they would take hands on , started to do , Alabama , Alabama , Alabama , God , God , God will take their hands on , started to do , Alabama , Alabama , Alabama , God , God , God 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
the interesting thing is , when Moore 野史 invasion of southern Spain , and they brought this practice within some interesting 野史 Moore empire is , when the southern Spain , and they brought this tradition and a few centuries , 颂词 sounds started to change from “ , Alabama , Alabama into “ ” 嘞 ” 嘞 , you know , you know , so a few centuries , 颂词 sounds started to change from “ , Alabama , Alabama into “ kept ” 嘞 嘞 ” today , you know , you can still in 斗牛 competition and 弗拉明 戈 喝彩声 heard of it . 
in Spain , when one performer done some incredible wondrous when people are going to give you all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , Alabama , really great , excellent . that &apos;s miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn waking for artists , the tricky is in the morning , the dancers have awakened 悠悠 turn that Tuesday morning 11 , he &apos;s not miracles phenotype . 
and that was just a bad leg , are going to the old mortals and he probably never achieve the height of the last night . 
maybe he &apos;ll never somebody dance with all are cheering you on your way miracles , since he was going to do ? 
this is a very hard question , which is the creation of knowledge , one of the most painful . 
this is a very hard question , which is the creation of self , understanding the pain of this is a very hard question , which is the creation of knowledge , one of the most painful . 
but maybe , we would have thought that if you were never thought , it is indescribably art completely from you , if you were never thought , it is indescribably art completely from you . 
if you think they &apos;re kind of magic , it &apos;s temporary use , you can bring you 精美绝伦 work if you think they &apos;re kind of magic , it &apos;s temporary use , you can bring you 精美绝伦 in art project , and you go to other people . 
if we think this problem , everything changed . 
in the past few months , I started by way of looking at this point in the past few months , I started by way of looking at this issue , and I do the writing a book that was dangerous , people who were , of the line , after my selling 大作 after work that was dangerous , people who were , of the line , after my selling 大作 later . 
and I need to do , is to keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : and I need to do , is to keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : “ , don &apos;t fear . just doing your job ” that part . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , just doing your job ” that part . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , just doing your job ” that part . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : if you &apos;re a dancer , which was dancing . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : if you &apos;re a dancer , which was dancing . 
if the sacred evil , but I decided that door 精灵 by showing you to make miracles , even if that &apos;s just a 瞬 the sacred evil , but I decided to use your door 精灵 to make miracles realm , it &apos;s just a 瞬 so that we all are cheering you on your way : you 嘞 ! 
if you didn &apos;t , well just go dancing , hold your jobs , as you all are cheering you on your way : I still kept 嘞 ! 
if you didn &apos;t , well just go dancing , hold your jobs , as you all are cheering you on your way : I still kept 嘞 ! 
and I believe that we have to teach it . 
if you fall in love with projects , hold jobs , that &apos;s worth 嘞 ! you all are cheering you on your way : if you fall in love with projects , hold jobs , that &apos;s worth 嘞 ! you all are cheering you on your way : if you fall in love with projects , hold jobs , that &apos;s worth 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you know , 嘞 ! 
from Al Gore here at TED , shows the new situation , think about climate scientists -- more than the tendency to worry about that , and he ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 area in the last of the equivalent of South America by 48 state is reducing 40 percent . 
but that doesn &apos;t exactly show it because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
like the polar ice cap -- just like the global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer at the heart actually hyperextending . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of a piece . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in a dark blue here is a form of the Year in the winter and summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing ” “ context , I &apos;m talking about five or more start to form of ice you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years , and it goes from here to here . 
notice that warming makes the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and being was freezing 干冰 -- clean from microbes defrost , methane , carbon . 
now , if it &apos;s where greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere , the total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in Lake already you can see that went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 to a shallow lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this massive heat , northern Greenland , the heat . 
this is a year melting of the river . 
but that doesn &apos;t flow in 往年 . 
this is a river kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the ice is sea level rise to the mouth of the Nung here is it . 
here &apos;s the traffic is rising . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent on reducing the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world that receive from being half of the drinking water . 
in the Andes , the ice is the city of drinking water . 
being traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent every year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
globally is causing the fire and dry more numbers . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are in relation to the earlier 七十五年 sums up four times . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years , we &apos;re adding CO2 to the oceans 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
watch the east to west , from the Pacific region in India , across the ocean and dramatically reduce 
the biggest problems of forest destruction , except for 20 percent of the oil fuel is burning . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution to build a much carbon in the coal . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see a sea change . 
this is what has and some of the new green alternative . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
coal oil industry and carbon and spent the last 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal that &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me ? 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee narco-tunnels muck billions of coal . 
you probably saw on the news 
here &apos;s the second largest wastewater lined up . 
this is a before and after Christmas . 
there &apos;s a kind of carbon -- coal industries . 
Mr. coal cool is happy and pleasant . 
in the United States , you can see him , he was very much about helping us economic development . 
Mr. coal cool every day to become more healthy . 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s virginia west , where a lot of coal . 
the head of the top is the coal mining massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy company in the CEO of BA , and energy company is in a series of environmental issue of law , major controversies that process from not close to the mosquito 污 measures core , Al ! and now nancy pelosi congressman 议长 congressman , Harry Reid and energy and business committee chairman -- and these two people to push through Congress a composite of energy and climate bills , these guys don &apos;t know they &apos;re talking about something . 
so the Alliance for Climate &#91; there is one of our current president and launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean do . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at , like the art of clean coal plants . 
some 喧哗 machine spectacular ! 
but that &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal with global warming is one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now a clean coal . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
the U.S. economy is a crisis , national security , climate crisis 
these are the strings together is based on carbon oil production is dependent on such messy import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve these problems . 
repower america 100 percent renewable electricity in the last 10 years . 
the ability to work for us to live more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a large enough of solutions to our problems . 
repower america , and learn more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
with the dirtiest oil in the murder of our planet , which is to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
the future is here . the wind and solar energy , a new network . 
the investment to create a new kind of work . 
repower america . it &apos;s time has ! 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far and fast . 
thank you very much . 
graduated from MIT , David 梅若 we demonstrated biscuits siftables -- which size , you can use my hands together , the computer building blocks of toys . it can be advanced arithmetic , playing music , and you &apos;ll be speaking . it would be a new generation of the learning machine ? 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about as you played kit . 
when you design and how to build with Legos to hands-on , and you &apos;re learning how to solve problems . this is about objects 空间结构 and feel . 
understanding of the 空间结构 really helps us to learn a lot of things around . 
so , as a computer scientist , in this field of hand-powered inspired by the way down , and in my mentor pattie and my partner , affordable kalanithi , I started thinking about -- if we could use a computer mouse cursor to move , a digital fingertips in desktop move -- would be ? if we could use a hand , directly sensory information on our ideas to combine information -- that will happen ? 
so the question is : did in my mind , so we decided to find answers , therefore it siftables . 
in short , which is a siftable interacting with computers , it &apos;s like the crackers . 
siftables by hand , you can move each 每块 siftable can perceive moves 每块 siftable each other , and the monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable &apos;s , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
this individual tools more and more sensitive to each other , with the sensory perception , any moving , so we can use these tools to try something new interesting interaction . 
now , I &apos;m going to demonstrate some simple . 
this is siftable reflection configuration that , if I take it to one side , that &apos;s shown in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they are a resounding 挨 a great , interesting things happen . 
if you give them a free , they will have noticed , which will have a mess . 
they can perceive moves with each other . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that put colors down from one another siftable siftable dumped . 
if you look at the demo , there are three dollars in barrels of oil paint patterns siftables , we can put into that bucket of color in the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and learning machine , I can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to learn from these functions , more quickly become on-the-spot that result . 
this is I &apos;m here to show why siftables -- it &apos;s me with a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
these words siftables she can play a game -- and scrabble boggle remix of games . 
this together in a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet siftable dollars , when you put a letter siftables together comprise words , siftables in dictionaries automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
so it . thank you . 
so now , on the screen at the Media Lab . some kids are in the experimenting with participation siftables experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word ” “ together , they know what to do . 
now on the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the lower right . this is the youngest of ages . 
he just siftables stack together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now on the screen a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is that the child &apos;s Felix . 
he could use some new elements into graphics , and he does is , pick up the desk siftables towards graphics , which you can bring these new components to it . 
see , he added up to the Sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now his tractor . add up . 
in orange . 
the good ! 
put towards siftables graphics can bring forth a new elements to this new element , he added up -- 吠 dogs . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open , at the end of the story of Project . how did this story . 
the balloon down off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last demonstration here in , playing music is even more recently , we &apos;ve developed siftables function in the sound domain , can make 超载 tone and Bess and drum . 
every tiles , had to regulate 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable hit you like . 
just to put sound come close to sound editors module . 
there is something like 响器 , which is a function of sound filter siftable module . 
put this kind of come close to sound tiles can adjust to sound . 
so , can control your rhythm and volume edited siftable tiles near the tiles siftable adjust the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two tiles 超载 into edit , and some 超载 note . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums modules that can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to speed up just put some tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now , and then bring a voice to turn the tiles tiles filter . 
music playing in the process , we can do . 
so , they don &apos;t need to even starting at all , it &apos;s based on that long and short . 
and finally , I would like to finish the play , with a volume edited tiles tiles on the left , close to this place . 
so it . thank you . 
as you can see , I was able to develop a new medium for computer-human interaction with the better in the brain works . 
today , I &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we &apos;re developing a new generation of combining cutting-edge technology -- and digital media 接轨 technology , it will give in change this world of innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I would love to talk to you about together .
