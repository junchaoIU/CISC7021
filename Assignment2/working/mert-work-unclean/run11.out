rapture , through photos and stories , for National Geographic by Wade Davis explorers of the world to celebrate culture as the Native Americans , these cultural diversity is at an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me , traveling around the world and in the anthropology of one of the most fun is not forget the experience of traditional populations , to live in the breeze touched by rainwater wash 晶莹 shining rock the taste of bitter lobes with it and you can feel their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 tiger going directly across the mythology of older people are Inuit notion that still in the Himalayas Buddhist empathy , or in following 法门 that remind us of the core of the human mind responsibility is it that we live in the world is not an absolutely consciousness , and it &apos;s just a reality is a model for sexual choice , and our ancestors in many generations ago we make that choice . 
of course we all follow the same sort of flexible rule . 
we are born in the world and 母腹 生儿育女 
we have to go through the adult week showered . 
we have cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find each song and dance rhythm , has unique signature . 
whether we &apos;re living in the jungle Krishna 伯南人 is still in Haiti taught voodoo 侍僧 or Northern Kenya Julius Sue 武士 安迪斯 mountains , desert 巫医 or the middle of the Sahara account and the hotel and a month , I used to go with this guy . he &apos;s a desert 结伴 牦牛 牧养人 life at the top of the world Everest hill . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you can now send this thinking makes you see the future . 
the world of cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by a spiritual life and culture of Internet cover the entire planet Earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the web 
you can put this culture of life on the web as a race in the loop loop that can be defined as a human has ever since that time by creating imagination all the ideas and dreams , myths and 之和 all intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , as we have a strong at the species . 
as the biosphere as the erosion of ethnic caps also facing the same shorter and its destruction faster . 
no one can say a 50 percent or more extinct species , or at the brink of extinction , because it &apos;s not the biodiversity of the most pessimistic situation would rather than the diversity of the most optimistic . 
this one is the most important sign language . 
we live on this planet have 6 : 00 native language 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is the human spirit , shining 
it &apos;s all a unique culture in this substance 承 carriers of the world . 
each one is a language , a conscious mind with a long-term ecosystem accumulate and precipitation 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language and all of us in the same amount of language , there is no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 effective rules that act , unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 where people can &apos;t tell ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky on Earth is about every two weeks , you will have to be a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
I know you people will say that wouldn &apos;t it be better if you only have a language that &apos;s not better ? so I want to say that this is the language of the Yoruba or 粤语 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore the race loop loop race , give you a rough and make you personally feel are lose civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I told you a different way of living “ ” I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 Northwest Bala Caesar pull 蚺 areas that they &apos;re called the race because they believe that a legend . they come from the river 米尔克 coming out of the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t distinguish between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 so in their 天穹 with no difference in the forest canopy 
they said a strange language and follow some rules 通婚 通婚 异族 linguistics called this with the people who have a different languages , married people . 
this is based on the mythology of history and legacy you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador race to the most amazing 华拉尼 is one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
1957 missionaries five years to approach them , but these people who made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the sky 十张 eight to have them . we think this is kind of , but they didn &apos;t think these people live in water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through these people trying to find the person , but they found nothing and they think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use 戮 with this missionary five died . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 external 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
people were dying 54 percent of their own 戮 dead people . 
we found only 一个八代 宗谱 to investigate our natural death 两例 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the more old people go to wood , they will die 戮 he 送终 for him . 
the other hand , they have a forest 惊诧 revealed . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I used to take a fantastic job at Harvard professor , I asked me if I was interested in Haiti , to go to a secret club that &apos;s the president and his 杜华利 Haiti supporters regime base of the professors allow me to go there and access to make a 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand the way I have to figure out what this mysterious religious voodoo taught how voodoo teaching is not a dark the magic . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some of the most important in the world will give you some examples of religion . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism some other religions . 
there &apos;s a continent forgotten still a lot of people think that sub-Saharan Africa , not a religious this is not right in the era of famine , these nomadic part of the world put their religion to teach voodoo there , and that &apos;s the essence of religion . 
voodoo unique about it is living with a connection between them . 
in living soul . 
the rhythm can tap dances 大水 to just replace under the soul of living in the spirit of that shining moment for 侍僧成 gods . 
so voodoo who likes to say you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach 侍僧 trance evident in a state of de-animation , but the branches of a sudden worse for wear when they enter the state of hyperactivity extreme , you &apos;ll see more startling fact that makes you feel resilience . 
when I was exposed to all of the community that lives in the mountains in northern Columbia 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is a race tyranny ancient civilization them once conquered and in the Caribbean coast in plain Columbia since they go back to the isolated mountains of a plain . 
in this continent globe in bloody ethnic that have never been to the Spaniards . 
and today , they will monk 续 along with the ruling , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
and when there &apos;s only three little 侍僧 that are gone away from their families in the darkness of the bottom of the stones into the house for two 十八年 to nine years of age , and it &apos;s a metaphor for the 40,000 fetuses in utero during 怀胎 in September . 
they like back 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain the is these values -- with the universe , we can call it the relationship between the balance . 
until they age , that magic of the first time they found out the sunlight hut see in the ground present mind-blowingly spectacular beauty that moment of a sudden , families that they had learned all knowledge abstract was an amazing honor recognized the rabbi . and see me . I used to teach you is true . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call myself lies call over , we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to create intuition . 
speaking of 风土人情 土族 residents and we &apos;re going to think about that Russell noble 野人 old legends that an ideal racist Thoreau we think about these people , more than we close . 
it will not indigenous 多愁善感 would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
in the prevailing malaria 阿斯玛 wetlands , in the wind &apos;s not much of Tibet 刺骨 this kind of rough terrain , but they are on land , just in the power of creating passed on the Best miracles , it &apos;s not because they consciously recognize this with very sensitive intuition , and they think of the world , because the human mind absorb the essence of nature . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can , for a living in the Andes children teach young adults , and he said that there is a mountain 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them as they are completely different category them with the environment and 生养 of a different relationship , in Montana , as a young man is just a bunch of rock that can be used to open 采石 mine . 
whether the mountain gods are segregated or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to the forest was cut down . 
and that makes me with one and a tribe , they become friends , two groups of people because they believe in heaven and 胡克神 these trees are the eye of the avatar 精灵 eat you in the north of the world in a bar mitzvah Landscape Hama in which these 精灵 with them . 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this is a picture of me this past August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
dead on the water and the wonderful thing is that it &apos;s not magic medicinal sex , and it is the machining , it actually made up of two things with one hand , it &apos;s a 藤本植物 β -- 咔 啉 蓬 硷 and small amounts of phantom hand , and then when you sit down on the cane , and you can see a blue smoke it to something called the 九节 carpenter &apos;s coffee from all the bush . 
this is a potent dopamine color of the components of it with brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe from people with serotonin , plants extract sucking nose , and with this thing . 
if you use a nose swallows the powder , you &apos;ll see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not , it &apos;s twisting 荡然无存 
in fact , I used to my mentor , Richard Evan shultes debate about in the 1930s , my mentor in Mexico to discover a magic mushrooms are very powerful effects of psychedelic I used to with his argument that you can &apos;t take these color dopamine belong psychedelic category then when you sit down , because when they &apos;re working on you play when you &apos;ve never experience psychedelic . 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs called a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine change . 
to these oral substance dopamine color and have to change oral 氧化酶 dopamine , one of the other chemicals . 
what &apos;s interesting is that in there -- β 藤本植物 咔 啉 alone can suppress the dopamine agonists color 氧化酶 and play the potency of everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
in the woods : 00 species has and how people are in the form of two , it can &apos;t relate to the plant together to play this remarkable experiments that are working as a biological component of a chemical effect than all the ingredients 之和 potency . 
ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments repeatedly measure outcomes are wrong 
but if you ask Indians plants , they would say to speak . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person found the cane is that they all die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to have some plants . 
you have some plants are not understand me . 
I tell you that if they said in the months of this 17 crop circle of every plant in the different languages singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. from Harvard , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a question we some of the indigenous people think they confront compassion 离群索居 enrich our lives , but over the world forward . these people stepped back to the edge of history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , and one of the people who are not going to happen , during the war , or its innovation and technology will remember in our time on Earth for positive , and the ecological diversity to mass destruction , or passively accept this situation , where still didn &apos;t change now . 
and all cultures have been influenced by the new way of life . 
this is not technology . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with interest is still Indians and the horse and carriage to sit still lives in the United States . 
the threat race intact layer is not change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
look at the world around us , you don &apos;t have a culture is destined to extinction of the energy that the rich people the power of rape them out of 生养 made them feel uncomfortable for them and ceaseless energy 伯南 heartland of deforestation and forest Southeast Asia , of the Lakota tribe 游民 on their generation also free and roam and pick up to live in the woods and has now for 沦落 仆役 and prostitutes called water , and you can see the sediment heavy seems to half the 罗族 南中国海 冲走 to live in Japan , where people are ready to go to sail cargo ship from the forest and cut down the circle of wood and Jamie 亚诺马 tribe , because there were people gold . 
let &apos;s see mountains Tibet recently where I did a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide is extinct cultural destruction people lifestyle crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of their praise strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet withstand 
and I was a young colleagues from China Northwest 成都市 go through 6 : 00 miles southeast of Tibet journey through to when I arrived in during during the time to really understand what you &apos;ve heard about the statistics of hidden in the Cultural Revolution 6 : 00 during the temple by the largest backbone Communist Party 120 million people were killed . 
and this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
he immediately after the invasion of Chinese people were killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together into Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
and he was only two his mother , his quietly in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister offend by behavior , and the 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of 臂章 to being executed for seven years of 劳教 nation . 
the pain of Tibet elusive human spirit bear redemption need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead before she had said in the most worried about is because we &apos;ve walked into this kind of their native worldview not only are we going to see the human imagination into more 陕 隘 thinking community and one day I woke up one day we forget this world there are other possibilities . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 drained there and make us feel guilty . 
新石器 into an agricultural revolution of human time , we would like to these seeds Beijerinck 腊 萨满 poetry is the rabbi . we &apos;ve created for all of this 社会分工 level 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
and I think this brief history was enough to have the capacity for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a species that are completely fully realize we have to make sure that all race and 昌盛 prosperity for all of life . 
I was in this picture was taken up in Northern 巴芬岛 I was with some of the Inuit , to catch the narwhals 奥拉雅 people told me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , Canada government doesn &apos;t do the Inuit , to build our national sovereignty , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family worried he was safe to put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the one advantage thick . 
their sleds across the street in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he slept on the outside in his skin seal 长裤 stool to put his fingers stiffen shit faster until he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 after freezes it becomes very robust after he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
the dog make a pair of skin 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds turned out to the other thing was don &apos;t have a dog that put shit knife made in the world . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of the life of indigenous 顽强 becomes real . 
April 1999 Canada government to an area the size of Texas and California than 之和 larger land returned back to the Inuit , 
I was our new home , it &apos;s name is Troy dimensions Le non-Inuit 
this is a control of their independence , where all the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country could do something with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think that ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about the fact that you can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s good at telling the truth of institutions we click on the website of the month of thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of play in a country . 
we had millions of readers magazine . 
we need to do is through a series of race tour takes us on the audience to see a culture of what they &apos;re going to see everything they can &apos;t help but masterpieces , and we hope to him and entertain pollen more inclusive , these cultural anthropology , is that the core of the world need variety of ways that we can actually live in a multicultural world for all the wisdom of all species for human well-being sinking difference . 
thank you . 
the Y aguera blaise arcas photosynth demo of this stunning , watching this software , we can change the way , using digital images from the picture , a static pick photosynth created a kind of stunning vision , and we can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth demo . 
first of all , I &apos;m going to use quickly show you some new technology , the basis of research . it &apos;s a year ago , Microsoft acquired our company , and we for Microsoft with this technology , it &apos;s a software . seadragon seadragon environment , you can use it to 近景 or vision to browse the vastness of data visualization . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of our digital photographs , they can continue to zoom in , and the larger context to browse through them , and they could rearrange them . 
no matter how many of all the data sets , images , and how big the images themselves , how big seadragon all have that kind of processing capability . 
most of these pictures were taken by digital cameras , and this example , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , it &apos;s not different restrictions system of performance , because the only factor is just , you &apos;re using the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I &apos;ll show you that this is really text , images , we can do this , and you can see that this is really text , not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I wouldn &apos;t recommend it . 
and here &apos;s one more example , this is an The Guardian . 
each one is a picture did starts . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we are doing a small change issues in The Guardian on it . 
we make them up a high-resolution picture advertising than that -- you see an ad regular , normal high resolution , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , and you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
in a way to avoid the actual use of the screen . 
we hope that this technology can reduce the window to be thrown like garbage information . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps and one of the applications . 
and yet , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these were just at NASA geospatial basis . 
and get a handle on top of the road map . 
now , let &apos;s put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this technology has online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different technologies . 
one is seadragon , and the other , from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely computer vision that research . this research , Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski help . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied , it &apos;s based on technology seadragon building . 
you can see here , we can easily picture of multiple ways to do , is able to look for images going at a more nuanced and resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the three-dimensional folding is actually a very meaningful . 
computer algorithms visual these pictures together , these images are going to be able to actually space out , and we &apos;re in this room took these pictures -- these are the Rockies , in Canada La Grou 西湖 grassi nearby lakes -- and the pictures -- here is the . so you can see here is stable slides of elements was larger context or MRI , and the content is all in space . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of this place it . 
and let &apos;s take a look at last summer , and we use a database of early noah photosynth what one of the early prototype . I think it &apos;s definitely the technology we 抢眼 . it &apos;s not just like we show the website that simple . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
here is the Flickr image on the site of Paris Notre Dame . you can do is website Flickr input “ Paris ” Notre Dame , and you can see a lot of pictures , including the photograph alleys , etc . , all of those orange color represents a cone to build models . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this 串联 by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
by this really , really exhilarating . 
I think you can see the original these images from a lot of different camera phone camera , from a single professional to the . so a lot of different quality , in this environment , were all together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here , there should be a sequence of images -- ah , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get in to see the poster to reconstruct the environment . 
so the important point here is that we can work with the community . we can start to get everybody &apos;s data to collect different environmental memories together , to build models . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all of them . 
this model menacing , what is the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like , &quot; The Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth &apos;s long tail market . 
this kind of model , and people used to be complex , become more valuable . 
pictures of , you will be in the tag . 
if people are willing to work in all these Notre Dame 圣贤 label went on , who they are , then we went to Notre Dame picture of the rich , and then , we can , in this picture , as a point in this space , this by many pictures of the virtual world , to build a model , across all across the user interface experience . 
and of course , this is another precious product is a very rich -- this is a model of the Earth every corner of landscape of interesting . the landscape , not just in the air and satellite images , but the real people pressing the shutter 一刻所 collection of the collective memory . 
thank you very much . 
if I understanding you right , the software is going to be in the years to 接合 images from around the world together ? 
software . this is actually is to explore . 
it builds up in this middle hypertext . 
this process is entirely 接合 images based on the content . 
the more exciting is that contains images of semantic text message . 
for example , you go on a picture , type , on the web to have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , the image with you ? 
now , so these semantic information to each other inside of links , and that &apos;s great . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist 施瓦茨 right in the center of the Western society , a credo -- the freedom to choose 施瓦茨 started in shock . it makes no more options and more freedom , let &apos;s get paralyzed . they don &apos;t we become more enjoyable will bring more unsatisfying . 
Barry 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I think I &apos;m here to talk about this book , and I hope it &apos;s part of what you &apos;ve already heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to go from a solid credo . 
what kind of creed ? 
it was the whole industrial 笃信 Western society , not by a credo . 
this creed it : if we allow people to get the welfare , its way is to maximize to individual liberty . 
and the reason is free , and that is good , valuable , for people to . 
and once people have freedom , each of us can 做主 using all the way to get to other people don &apos;t have welfare , for 做主 . 
the freedom to be a big enough to do is increase selective . 
people , more and more freedom , freedom , getting more and more welfare . 
I think , like the idea , so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in that nobody wanted to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of contemporary look forward , social progress , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
I was a supermarket 175种 pronouncement salad ingredients , there &apos;s the first 10 different would have specialized sign 榨 olive oil and vinegar 12 balsamic grapes 选购 , if you let that happen to be 175种 salad sauce and all of your taste , that you can use them hook and a large number of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets . 
and then you turn out to be a pop-up stores one configuration that includes a stereo system -- a CD , blah , blah , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores one in stereo system is countless more . 
with this store components that you can have a combination of the last 650万种 three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , Bell Maya , you have to go , just a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually died at the phone , it &apos;s not all bad . 
the days 一去不返 already . 
now we have almost infinite variety of mobile phone , especially . shows . 
these are the future of mobile phones . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play and cutting hair , a French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
and if you haven &apos;t in your next to the store , seen with no , don &apos;t worry about how you &apos;ll see . 
this is the outcome , people running into shops asking : you have a function of not so much ? 
you think about it , answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a not so many things stem cell phones . 
again , in some other lives more than a shopping thing for us , this effect on the explosion of choice . 
the health care -- not in the United States , right now is that you go to your doctor , doctors told straightforward , how do you do era . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment nail , can also use 乙 solution . 
and so forth and make a solution nail risk . 
and so forth and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
they say that again , nail has these effects , and risk 乙 has the negatives and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” ? 
the psychiatrist says , but I “ ” not you . 
and the result is what we call the patient . municipalities “ ” sounds like pretty good . it &apos;s actually bring to bear responsibility and do it from a people who know how to do that , I mean , to a doctor 转嫁 treatments , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t require , can make decisions in the state of the people who , which is the patient . 
now the prescription for pharmaceutical ad , all that the ordinary people around you and me . if you think about it , it &apos;s just say , we can &apos;t buy directly to counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they want an ad after we looked at the next morning , go to your doctor , the doctor to call on a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our identity , gender , this kind of thing became a choice . just like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we could get back to shape their gender identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of men and women are the decision . 
in the marriage of families in the past , everybody got married , and it &apos;s almost like age for granted , then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who are married , rather than when I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , everything could pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart magnificant students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework for almost one . 
it &apos;s not because they were dumb , students -- and it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so hardworking . 
now the reason is their brains are filled with all sorts of things , and I ask myself , what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and then I &apos;ll come back to first child , and I knew business ? 
this is 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether or not they do I do homework , whether they in my class and take a grades . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology allows us to any one time , in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant where you can have a WiFi , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I also want to use . 
and we work with these incredible that we have freedom of choice is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for your job is to break moved . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 on the phone , another 裤兜 with the BlackBerry blackberry lap , and still holding laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are looking at the same rivals for kids in constantly ask yourself , or you don &apos;t pick up the phone ? 
or you don &apos;t go back to this email ? should I wrote this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no child , you know that this is the experience of the game is severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big stuff , and was lifestyle , lifestyle choice is . 
we live in the world . 
that means , choice is still there , but not have nothing to choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we have marker of liberation , but not tied , is paralysis . 
so many choices that people have found a very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a peer-to-peer pension plan to invest in terms of research . 
a colleague of mine came in contact with vanguard investment , vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million employees and two , 000多个 office . 
she is , when surveyed the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of species increases every 10 to reduce the number of two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 people than five fund down when you give 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it was even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow halide tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
we know what it means that when people to retire , may have only use 充饥 dog food , because they don &apos;t have drawn enough money to the future , and decided to do , because it &apos;s so hard to even employer , that they are fairly impressive . it &apos;s all the symmetrical for a grant give up . 
don &apos;t join the plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide are obsessed with this . 
so many choices , possibilities and the result is numb . 
it makes our world looks like this and this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose wrong helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
and it &apos;s the first -- so negative impact . and here &apos;s the second , even if I go through trying to overcome rigid and paralysis and finally made a right , we decided to make decisions and we can choose sexual 少时 more decisions . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
one is , so many salad ingredients species , if you buy a , think about , you &apos;re very easy to imagine if you pick another . and what happens ? in this massive influx of choice and your decision that you have to feel regret , that makes you feel remorse for your choice out of the satisfaction , even though it was a good choice . 
choice , more easily inexplicably something to feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction to choice . 
and second , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a is enough , we see a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of options , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the many ways , and that makes you like to think that you see the 美中不足 . 
so , for example that cartoons , and if you are not New York , I &apos;ll 歉 a dish . 
but this is what you should think about things . 
look at these two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
it can be better than this ? this is where the hapless “ huh , really , is now “ ” ” in August . 
Manhattan “ of your neighbors are not home , ” 
I &apos;m going to “ is to stop that can go back to my door ” . 
and two weeks , he was such an idea , torture 念叨 lost in every day , that &apos;s the best chance . 
the opportunity cost “ ” always has enabled us to make decisions , even with enough to actually quite remarkable . 
we have choices , the more attractive in these options and more stuff , and these things are opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also said the “ present ” . it &apos;s probably going to do step . 
one of them , but it is , when you choose to do something , you can choose not to do other things . 
the other thing you have a lot of tend to decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I have to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy them back , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to be washed so many times , get 凑合 pants . 
so , in the years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , &quot; Hey , I want a jeans , this is my size ” . 
the counter said , you have to type , the comfort of sweatpants , or is it ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
to quickly that grinds them ? 
and back , and the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw nearly fall down . when I got over , I said , I &apos;m going to “ that was only one ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I spent a 钟头 all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , I brought one of my most never 合身 pants out the door . 
I do not really wrong . those choices that I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , and the reason is because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a jeans exactly how good to be greatly good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when a jeans is so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really nice , but it isn &apos;t perfect . 
so I have , I had to go and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expected of me , this becomes disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together , in addition to improve people what to do a lot of good from bad didn &apos;t give people with many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not understand this , because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all terrible things all over the last better than today . 
one of the reason is , when things are not good people could experience to some surprises . 
now , in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
you will never be what surprises , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , which is you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so it , I think , let &apos;s take a little bit of time , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
I don &apos;t have the 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
and finally , don &apos;t buy a 合身 jeans is one of the shops , when there &apos;s only one pattern , you can buy , that doesn &apos;t want to know why , who is responsible ? the answer was clear . the world is responsible . what do you have to do ? 
now there &apos;s hundreds of jeans shop for you bought a pair of choice . you don &apos;t think back , happy , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer is : you . 
you can do better . 
and out there in hundreds of jeans , you have no excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good -- to disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world now in clinical explosive growth is depressed . 
I believe that if the suicide explosive growth and an important , not the only , but it &apos;s important factor , which is all of those disappointing . why is the standard is too high . when they have to explain these experiences what &apos;s going on , they think it &apos;s been themselves . 
and the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like before . 
I remind you . 
this led to the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no doubt have no choice , but can &apos;t abandon picture choose more is better . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond our ’ ‘ choose the richest and the key value . 
I said . here is a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many choices , a lot of matter . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world where , at least , we heard a few of them , where it &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies on a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we make those expensive and difficult to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated choice to not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us as before . 
if we take this society to create these options out of the system to commit to people who are not enough to go out of choice , not only the lives of people there can be improved quality of life , we also improved for . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us as plague of extra choice . 
the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position of intelligence , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting , it was interpreted . 
but I want to feel more clearly this fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the happiness . 
you have increased was paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and in this fish -- for this fish , maybe a little bit , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish and that means to be suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
we can “ from the digital world in creating new life ? ” Craig Venter . he said , the answer is “ can ” and it &apos;s going to happen . he introduced his recent research and commitment and very soon we will have created the ability to activate a pair chromosome . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to the digital code in biology , to a new design , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” , I think many biologists are constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now we have almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from analog in biology , computer analysis of September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome to make it replicate in the lab , and we &apos;re trying to understand whether we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes that we 一百组 dissociate these . 
but when we look at its metabolism , this is actually relatively simple relative to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple , but when we look at all that we can separate out at the genome , it &apos;s hard to believe that they can create a living cell . 
so , we can continue to think that the only way is to study these synthetic chromosome so we can change its component of questions to continue the basic problem . 
so we started to walk along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
it allows us to chemical principle that we never succeeded in making these molecules displayed ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
pair chromosome , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life in an exponential rate and speed . 
we write the genetic code , the ability to progress very slowly , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact after several steps . when we did before , the first trial conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
we have 十几万台 device in the little pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline of the process , the more fragmented , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first tried Phi X 174 , from the phage genome and digital information . 
kill bacteria is a small virus . 
we designed it genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
the other stages of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually in software can make a biological system , the hardware . 
but we want to expand . we want to make the entire bacterial chromosomes , a symbol , more than 10,000 580 length of the genetic code . and we think we should be in the size of the virus ” “ box , make them so that we can change these ” “ box to understand a living cell components is actually ? 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that those numbers to accurate information . 
when we first in 1995 for this group of subjects , gene sequencing is every 10,000 to a fundamental mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to 30 , the average is wrong . if we use the genetic sequence , this would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design 50 symbol of other than the character of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
one of the design of the unique part . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts like about 20 amino acids , every amino acids tag a character . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we don &apos;t use it for a poem . 
we designed and that can use the bias enzyme which cuts . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from 70 length of time to put them together to create a character that &apos;s the length of time and pull out into the merger fragments , at the time . 
at every stage , we produce a lot of these fragments , so we can give them precise , because we wanted to create a very reliable process , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 graph . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 basic when they &apos;re hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to make the modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology , to repair DNA , and it takes time together 
here &apos;s an example of microbes called resistant to be able to withstand 三百万度 球菌 radiation dose of radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , before the original . 
we can do that , there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes to be completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule . these microscopic images through the process , which is what the yeast , and the way we design and put it into the yeast . they will automatically , essentially . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than the genetic code 580000 character . it &apos;s by humans setting the structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font to print out of it . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how are we going to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do a very simple more complicated . 
we deal with this kind of like that and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in the other cells , this is what you heard about cloned . 
for the bacterial chromosomes , they &apos;re acting 连成 with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to another cells and activate it . 
we go from a population of microbes extract chromosomes . basically , it &apos;s the difference between humans and mice . we added a new set of genes that we can choose those chromosomes . we use them to get rid of the enzyme , from all the proteins when we put it into the cells of a very amazing happens when you should be like we &apos;re making fantastic presentation -- images . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought that just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosomes species or from elsewhere in the third one second of the thousands and thousands of new feature to its own . 
people were held in the process of evolution and just have a genetic change the perception of ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzymes are able to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of the cell and not without this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
they do it , and recognize the other chromosome is no matter , it is to digest , finally , we have a new have DNA . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the species out of the characteristics , and completely gone into a new species , we put the new software “ ” cells . 
all the proteins will change the membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is that we actually implant . 
this may seem like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do that ? 
I think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people on each of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , become four . 
we provide 65亿 for food , clean fresh water , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s nine billion people which 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace or any application , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is this material of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
now we have found from around the world has about a database of 两千万组 genes , and I like to see them as the future of design components . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry components , to learn from that , if you look at the diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can build what we call the mixing “ ” group of very synthetic . 
what we have the ability to build a robot that allows us to make a million chromosomes a day . 
when you think this processed 两千万组 different gene , and try to optimize the steps that create drugs or 辛烷 制剂 , and new vaccines , and we can change , even a small team , can do better than the last 20 years of science have done more molecular biology . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can choose to survive , the ability to produce biofuels , or chemical production , vaccines , and so forth . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is that we actually sit at work in the computer to really design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value for fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
but we think the only biology can make a huge impact on the food and not limited to increase the spending it can use to is that if we can start using CO2 as its ingredients . so we &apos;re designing a new cells that make this a viable . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and CO2 is one of the ways -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water temperature . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane , translated into the molecules of its energy source . 
we &apos;re able to see if their collections of two very convenient , then , they can be introduced into processing , fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we may be able to increase the life ? &quot; &quot; what are the basic problem . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry , the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there might be a major ? energy . 
and we also use the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you can all of this flu , we &apos;re always going on in a year , and lack of money , when the vaccine useful . 
I think it can be mixed vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last belong and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better farther away from human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure we get a chance to live long enough , maybe you can do that . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox shares some which super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
last year at TED I introduced the LHC . 
and I said to update it back to talk about the machines running . 
and here it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we use these little changes to probe the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas shine down . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of the LHC along the way we are part of the LHC with plans , a lot of particles in the heat 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September this picture , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know this is a 满堂喝彩 or is this -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of research on this same shock . 
but about a week later , our machines out of the main point with these 导线 导线 about -- the gold . 
these 导线 conduction 安培 current when they all machine . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
and so on the planet below minus 271摄氏度 space between the temperature of these cases 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a technical installation 接点 there is a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises a little bit of transmission it leads to more 安培 current and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because those magnets material they move it weighs about a mile rule . 
we have about 50 magnets impaired . 
to put them down , unloaded the work has accomplished . 
we gave them joy . it &apos;s good . 
now , they come back into the ground . 
in about three of refer to be the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data and continue our mission to figure out the most basic units . 
now obviously , so one of these accidents back about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s still too difficult task we seek truth and projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
and finally , I want to a British scientists 复述 戴维翰 warren , and I remember him as an apprentice myself in defense of meaningless -- he was an apprentice , Michael 法拉 chapter -- said , for the human brain development , nothing more dangerous idea : think we have to understand science as mysteries of all , there &apos;s something we &apos;ve so 全胜 stop to explore . 
thank you . 
for those incredibly great social contemporary art , to get the creator itself , and people &apos;s genius exposed to art , unusual . Elizabeth Gilbert for this to explore and thinking , asking for creating genius 独到 : think of some guy &apos;s genius “ ” , than in his or her work with the help of genius “ ” . this fun and personal talk , vivid 令人感动 color , and of inspiration . 
Elizabeth Gilbert . what about art and creativity 呵护 reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently in my life work a special events that happened , but recently in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
this particular event was : my most recent book published in The 回忆录 that food , pray , &quot; love this particular event was : my most recent book published in The 回忆录 that food , pray , &quot; I love that used to work as a very generic somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller 
now , as a result , no matter where I think , people are my life as a result , no matter where I now , that people think that &apos;s my life . 
really , like , completely , saved , play 完了 ! 
they would be very anxious , came to me and said , you don &apos;t be afraid “ ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
you don &apos;t “ . you write that will forever and forever , but not write a piece of that love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d write that will forever and forever , but not write a piece of that love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d write that will forever and forever , but not write a piece of that love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever , but you don &apos;t write about love ” work ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was very difficult to date , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , I decided to become a writer , things that seem to have a very difficult , but luckily , 20 years ago I remembered writer decided that I was a teenager , I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
I &apos;ve confronted the same question , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid to continue bearing down upon you ? 
you don &apos;t work . it was a lifelong ? you don &apos;t work . it was a lifelong ? you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the pain of failure , and you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure . 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , I was always get questioning , etc . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of scary everything else today . 
yes , this kind of scary everything else today . 
well beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that many people suspect that not beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I kept thinking , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I kept thinking , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is a cerebral idea ? 
people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? 
creative work is the thing that makes us for mental health worry about the creative work ? what &apos;s the thing that makes us for mental health worry ? up other industries that don &apos;t do this , right ? 
for example , my dad was an engineer chemistry in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked him if he was afraid to become a chemical engineer in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked him if he was afraid to become a chemical engineers . 
nobody says : “ John , working with chemistry ? bottlenecks ” ? 
could never ask this happened . 
of course , engineers , chemical 平心而论 it just doesn &apos;t in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 down the writer , and we actually have that kind of reputation , not only the writers fields creative people seem to have emotions , very violent 恶名 fields writer , not only creative people seem to have very violent 恶名 emotion . 
just look at the early last century , in areas with great geniuses 英年早逝 case for early last century look different areas , with great geniuses 英年早逝 is often the case before died of suicide . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent . 
Noam 曼梅 , died in the last time I said , in every book “ all 蚕食 ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , this is how aggressive . 
but we wanted to 视若无睹 story , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 . but we wanted to 视若无睹 story , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 and somehow , people are totally accepted internalize that these ideas , creativity and suffering , creating art that will eventually lead to extreme 苦闷 , this idea is , creativity and suffering , creating art that will eventually lead to extreme 苦闷 
today I want to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in species . 
this view , and not only 可憎 terrible , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century . 
this view , and not only 可憎 terrible , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century 可憎 , not only that , and awful , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses live there will be good . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I myself , believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and probably , from this moment , I write a piece of will be used to and I was an incredibly tragic event in a book of comparing , isn &apos;t it ? will be used to and I was an incredibly tragic event in a book of comparing , isn &apos;t it ? 
and frankly , we have to look at the time , I would say , is the heart and friends , right , potentially , I &apos;ve been the most successful . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of idea ! 
is this idea , who took a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back , is this idea , who took a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be like that . 
I don &apos;t want to continue , I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deep thinking , I think , to keep writing , and I have to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create some psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from writing is extremely anxiety , and I work for extreme anxiety received . 
a year ago , I can look for reference , in history , and find out in different cultures around looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and find out in different cultures around looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and look at different cultures , to see if they have better , more than our intellectual ideas to help 艺术工作者 art with what &apos;s inside of emotions , inherent to help risk 艺术工作者 art with what &apos;s inside of emotional risk . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we sent back to end up . 
that in Ancient Greece and ancient Rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is one of the sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called this to universal creativity of accompanied 精灵 as stewards for “ ” 
and people often think Socrates stewards for a there , he gave away from general wisdom was that people think that there &apos;s a Socrates stewards for wisdom gives him from a distance . 
the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius “ ” 精灵 called 
this wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
they think is a wonderful ” “ genius of the sacred , and they even think “ ” talented artist living in the walls of the studio , like little 精灵 than as they even think “ ” talented artist living in the walls of the studio , like little 精灵 than they would come quietly , glass artists to help , and they &apos;re going to work on 成败 drilling quietly , glass artists to help , and 成败 work . 
it &apos;s amazing , this is what I was looking at this safe distance from work is to protect the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by this ancient artists and get protection , averted narcissistic ancient artists , by this view and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of ” “ genius of the project . 
if you work a terrible , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is in the last Westerners for a long time about creativity . 
and then the Renaissance , everything changed , and people had a great idea , and then the Renaissance , everything changed , and people had a great idea : “ , let &apos;s take a human heart , in the universe beyond the gods mysterious and unknown ” “ , let &apos;s take a human heart , in the universe beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown ” space that never leave the gremlin who will deliver sacred . 
this is the beginning of humanism rational , people start to believe that all creativity comes from an individual human itself , and this is the beginning of humanism rational , people start to believe that all creativity comes from an individual human itself , and this is the beginning of humanism rational , people start to believe that all creativity comes from the human beings . 
the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
for one person , a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred and create these things and unknown , the source of jihad , and he asked for fishes swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , is too big . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , is too big . 
this was completely warps the one &apos;s perception , and to make an individual . completely down to this one &apos;s perception , and for the immense personal achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists , I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artist . 
if that is true , at least I think , is this so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking developed 500多年 rational human mind , we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
and maybe in the audience today , they are grounded in evidence that people can ask questions of science , and maybe in the audience today , they are grounded in evidence that people can ask this question of science 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on this idea of water ridiculous 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , to work on the water as high as a ridiculous idea . 
maybe I could not convince you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but , I mean , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
that &apos;s all kinds of explaining the uncertainty of the creative process , the theory of 精灵 theory and I &apos;ve heard all other theories -- or as fair to say this irrational 精灵 theory and I &apos;ve heard all other theories as rational as irrational or so . 
this process , for any of you who &apos;ve tried to make sure you all sitting there going through this process that &apos;s not always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
for example , I met the great American poet bowhead silk . 斯通 bowhead silk 九十多岁 , she has been a poet and she said she was growing up in Virginia , in a life of the things that she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance . 
like on a breath of emptying down her face . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with her only one thing is to really “ ” dashed across 
she goes home dashed across , and all the way to this poem after her home , she would dashed across this poem after all the way to her , she explained to find a pen to paper , and in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , put it on paper that she explained to find a pen and paper , in which power to capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , put it on paper that she explained to find a pen and paper , in which power to capture through her , that it &apos;s a poem written in the paper . 
sometimes she wasn &apos;t fast enough and crazy , she went , there &apos;s home , and that &apos;s a poem Pentium , so she would miss the poem , crazy , she didn &apos;t home , and that &apos;s a poem Pentium , so she would miss it , and she said , it will continue to mass-produce swimming , find a poet ” “ down , and she said it will continue to mass-produce swimming , looking for “ next ” poet . 
in other , and this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said she sometimes are almost 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running home for a pen and paper , it &apos;s going to go through her , she was going through it , it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and it &apos;s going to go through her , she was going through it , it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and she &apos;s the other hand , it &apos;s her tail , and the other hand , grab that poem tail . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the last word go by , after all , the word . 
except that sequence is upside down , from the last word go by , after the first words , I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , the creative process , I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , the creative process . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , my job more like a so . 
and of course , it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I works more like a day , so I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work every day , I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get devoted to work . 
but even as 古板 , sometimes I get inadvertently inspired surprising , but even as 古板 , sometimes I get inadvertently inspired . 
in many of you may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what was going on here ? 
in how we &apos;re going to look at it , not rational ? we have lost in how to look at it , don &apos;t have lost rational ? 
what I knew contemporary artists , to deal with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 what I knew contemporary artists , to deal with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 a few years ago , I was a magazine , and his job interview we talk about this problem . 
a few years ago , I was a magazine , and his job interview we talk about this problem is Tom or creative stress of modern artists or Tom &apos;s typical of the stress of modern artist delivers a typical spend time , he has been trying to control , management and run that controlled the inspiration spend time , he has been trying to control , management and run that controlled the inspiration spend time , he has been trying to control , management and run that controlled the creative inspiration .

since that happened , Tom changed the creative process . 
it doesn &apos;t work , he still is completely dark . 
but when he put creation to pull itself from genius , with the creative process by which severe anxiety challenge , but when he put creation to pull itself from genius , with the creative process by which severe anxiety to transform the inspiration is the self , it &apos;s just a pain in trouble , and it was liberated 倒像 原处 , put it back , and he realized he doesn &apos;t have to take inspiration from within , tortures itself . 
he can inspiration , and this is the unknown between the weird and surprising and strange relationship with his inspiration is that the unknown between the weird and surprising and strange relationship that &apos;s a beyond ourselves .

the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer , the professional performing a wonderful , wonderful , because they are a professional dancer . 
occasionally , although very rare , but actually going to happen one dancers going beyond the transcendent 出世 . 
you know that I should say that because you &apos;ve all seen at some point , like that . 
time to stop , as the dancers through time to stop , as the dancers through what he did before and 1000场 performance isn &apos;t anything different , but all amazingly , it all together .

everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
the interesting thing is , when Moore 野史 invasion of southern Spain , and they brought this practice interesting 野史 Moore empire is , when the southern Spain , and they brought this tradition and a few centuries , to change , and the 颂词 “ from Alabama , Alabama into ” “ 嘞 ” 嘞 , you know , you know , so a few centuries , to change , and the 颂词 “ from Alabama , Alabama into ” kept “ 嘞 嘞 ” today , you know , you can still in 斗牛 competition and 弗拉明 戈 喝彩声 heard of it . 
in Spain , when a performer done some incredible wondrous when people are going to give you all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , Alabama , really great , excellent . that &apos;s ” miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 artists to wake up , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 awake at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning that is , he &apos;s not miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old mortals and , maybe he couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe he &apos;ll never somebody dance with miracles all are cheering you on your way since he was going to do ? 
this is a very tricky issues , are among the most painful my perception of self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most of my self , understanding the pain of this is a very tricky issues , are among the most painful my perception of self .

in the past few months , I started by way of looking at this point in the past few months , I started looking at it this way . and I do the writing a book that was dangerous , people who were , of the line , after my selling 大作 after work that was dangerous , people who were , of the line , after my selling 大作 later . 
and I need to do , is to keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : and I need to do , is to keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : “ , don &apos;t fear . you just have to do good ” that part of the work .

thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you 嘞 ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists think is worth more than the predictions about , and that for his ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of South America by 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but they can &apos;t show it because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
it felt , the polar ice cap -- just like the global climate system beating heart 
in the winter and summer at the heart actually hyperextending . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter , this is a form of the Year in the summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing permanent “ ” form , I &apos;m talking about five or more of ice you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a massive amount of carbon and by was freezing . 干冰 defrost , methane , carbon clean from microbes . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in Lake already you can see the went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is one of the last year . 
but 往年 than traffic . 
this is a river kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
here &apos;s the traffic is rising . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
from 40 percent of the world its molten get half of the drinking water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice , drinking water . 
increase in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
the world is causing the fire and dry more numbers . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are in relation to number four 七十五年 earlier . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the last five years we added CO2 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions to the oceans . 
watch the Pacific region from the east to west of India , in the ocean and dramatically reduce both . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a used to use more carbon -- coal planet . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see a sea change . 
this is what has and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and carbon -- coal and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal that &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me ? 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee out of coal muck billions of dollars . 
you probably saw on the news 
here , the second largest put up the waste water . 
this is before Christmas . 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and pleasant . 
in the United States , you can see him , he was very much about helping us economic development . 
Mr. cool coal every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s virginia west , where a lot of coal . 
the head of the top is the coal mining massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy companies , and CEOs of energy in the company is in the legal environment with a controversial issue , the process of extraction that didn &apos;t take the mosquito 污 measures core , Al ! and now 议长 nancy pelosi congressman , Harry Reid congressman and energy and business committee chairman -- so two people to push through Congress a composite of the energy bill climate , these guys don &apos;t know they &apos;re talking about something . 
so the E.U. and climate protection is one of the current and work on two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of putting the coal mining and the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , is it smells good quality . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art as a clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal with global warming is one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now a clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the national security and economic challenge . 
in the U.S. national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis . 
these are the strings together is based on carbon , such as the product of oil dependency on imported dirty oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve these problems . 
repower america clean with 100 percent of the last 10 years of electricity . 
the new work life , let &apos;s get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america know more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet , which is to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
the future . here &apos;s the wind , solar energy , new network . 
investment to create a new kind of work . 
repower has america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
graduated from MIT , David 梅若 demonstrates our siftables -- the size of the crackers , you can use my hands together , the computer building blocks . it can be toy advanced arithmetic , playing music , and you &apos;ll be speaking . it would be a new generation of the machine learning ? 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about as you &apos;re playing kit . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re thinking and learn how to solve problems . this is the object 空间结构 to understand and feel . 
understand very 空间结构 objects around to help us learn a lot of things . 
so , as a computer scientist , in this field hand-powered inspired by the way down , and in my mentor pattie and my partner , affordable kalanithi , I started thinking about -- if we could use a new computer mouse to move the cursor , a digital fingertips in desktop move -- that would ? how can we use to direct your hands , sensory information on our ideas to combine information -- that would do ? 
the questions that are sitting in my mind , so we decided to find answers , so it &apos;s siftables . 
in short , siftable interaction is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable each other , sense each other , and move 每块 siftable monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable &apos;s , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
this individual more tools , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any moving the subtle , so we can use this tool to try something new interesting interaction . 
now , I &apos;m going to show some simple . 
this is siftable reflection configuration , if I put it side to it , so that &apos;s in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they are a resounding 挨 , an interesting phenomenon that happen . 
if they have a bunch of , they will have noticed , that would have a mess . 
they can perceive moves with each other . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that put down from a color siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , this one in three siftables barrels of oil paint patterns , we can put these bucket pour the color in the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions , on-the-spot learning to become more quickly that result . 
this is I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- it &apos;s me with a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this word to build a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable dollars , and when you put a letter of siftables together words , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell that change the sequence of the words , right , you can also trying to build new letters , in other words . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , some of the screen in the Media Lab siftables experimenting with participation in the experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this is the youngest of ages . 
he just wanted to siftables stack together . 
in his mind , just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he could use some new graphics to add elements , and he does is table siftables towards pick up some graphics , you can put these new to add elements animation . 
see , he added up the sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David his tractor . add up . 
in orange . 
do good ! 
put towards siftables graphics can bring forth a new add elements to this add up to his new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plan , his story . 
the balloon down off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last show this to function , playing music is even more recently , we developed this siftables function in sound domain , can make 超载 note , the sound of drums and Bess . 
everybody has tiles that 四档 modulation , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable hit you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a sound filter , which 响器 of siftable module . 
put this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control the overall rhythm and volume edited tiles siftable to adjust the tiles siftable rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two editors 超载 into modules , and some 超载 . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums modules , it can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to accelerate the pace of just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to put sound filter tiles near Manchester shellfish filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can also . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance , but in playing , all based long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with tiles volume edited tiles on the left , close to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium computer-human interaction with better human brain . 
today , I &apos;ll show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we developed a new generation of combining cutting-edge technology -- and digital media 接轨 technology to bring to the world , it would change this revolution in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
