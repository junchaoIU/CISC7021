rapture photos and stories through for National Geographic , the explorers by Wade Davis celebrated the diversity of extraordinary indigenous culture , that &apos;s an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me , traveling around the world and in the anthropology of one of the most fun is not forget the experience of traditional groups of life in the wind to wash it by touch the rock light 晶莹 torture lobes with it . you can feel their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 to tigers are Inuit directly across the mythology of the notion that still empathy , or in following in the Himalayas Buddhist 法门 that remind us of the core of the human mind responsibility is it that we live in the world is not an absolute awareness of a reality , it &apos;s just a model for sexual choice , and our ancestors in many generations ago to make that choice . 
and of course , we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born in the world and 母腹 生儿育女 
we &apos;re going to experience of adult would 
we have the brutal 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find that every culture rhythm song and dance with the rhythm of unique . 
whether it &apos;s living in the jungle Krishna is 伯南人 voodoo in Haiti taught 侍僧 or Northern Kenya Julius Sue 武士 安迪斯 mountains , desert 巫医 or the Sahara desert around the middle of an eating-place account for a month I used to the people he &apos;s a desert to 结伴 牦牛 牧养人 live in the top of the world Everest hill . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you send will now be thinking that you see hope . 
the world of cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by a mental life and culture web of life cover the whole planet it had a very important 芸芸众生 of the Earth as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the web 
you can put this culture of life , the web as a race , layer by layer , race , this is a human since has been created by imagination that all the ideas and dreams , myths , 之和 all intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , as we have a strong at the species . 
as the biosphere of race and the same with the end of the destruction of , and it faster . 
no one can say a 50 percent or more extinct species , or at the brink of extinction . because the truth of the most pessimistic biodiversity and the cultural diversity than the most optimistic . 
this one of the most important is the language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 language 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is a flash of the human spirit 
it &apos;s all of the spirit of the unique culture in this substance 承 carriers of the world . 
each one is a language of ideas and a long-term ecosystem accumulate and precipitation 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language and we all in the same number of language , there is no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that do work unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you say , the last one is people can &apos;t be 本族语 lineage ancestors and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , a horrible about every two weeks on the planet will be with a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
I know you people would say that wouldn &apos;t it be better if you only have a language that &apos;s not better ? so I want to say that this is the language of the Yoruba or 粤语 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore the race to the race , you know the circle there and make you personally feel are lose civilization . 
there &apos;s a lot of people said I forgot the “ different way of saying I ” “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 pull the Arabic that they &apos;re called 蚺 areas of a political race because they believe that they were born in the 米尔克 coming from the sacred about snakes . 
the groups of people can &apos;t tell the difference between the green and blue because they are so of 栖身 天穹 in their with no difference between the forest canopy 
they said , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 异族 linguistics called a 通婚 to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this is based on through the history of mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language is a very often , you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador race to the most amazing 华拉尼 is one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five years to missionary 1957 to these people , but they made a fatal mistake . 
they from the air , they 十张 eight to it . we think this is a picture of friendly , but they don &apos;t think these people live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through these people trying to find the person , but they found nothing and they think it &apos;s called the Devil . and they use with this missionary five 戮 die . 
more terror is not only 华拉尼 戮 external die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
we found only to investigate 宗谱 一个八代 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the old people . the wood is going to do , they &apos;ll 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have the amazing 惊诧 perspective . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I used to take a fantastic job at Harvard University professor , I asked if I &apos;m interested in Haiti , to go to a secret club that &apos;s Haiti president and his 杜华利 base of the support of a professor , I went there to make a profit 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand the secret I have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo taught how to teach voodoo is the magic of a dark . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some important religion in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
there &apos;s a continent still a lot of people think forgotten sub-Saharan Africa have no religious belief and it &apos;s not the right time famine in these areas around the world nomadic people put their religion to teach voodoo and there &apos;s the essence of these religions . 
voodoo unique about it was born with the connection between 
in living soul . 
the rhythm of the dance can tap 大水 to replace &apos;s soul of the soul of the living in the short for 侍僧成 shining moment . 
so voodoo who like to say you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach 侍僧 trance evident into a state of de-animation , but the branches of a sudden worse for wear when they enter the state of hyperactivity extreme , you &apos;ll see more amazing phenomenon make you feel resilience . 
I have all of life in the north of Columbia in the mountains of 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of isolated in a plain . 
in this bloody ethnic this continent globe has never been to the people . 
and today , they will monk along with 续 rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
and the only have three young 侍僧 is take away from their families in the dark gone on the bottom of the stones into the house for two 十八年 to nine years of age , and it &apos;s a metaphor for the 40,000 fetuses in utero during 怀胎 in September . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain is these values and the relationship between the believers , and we can call it the balance . 
until they age of this amazing when they first came out of his house to see the sun in the ground present mind-blowingly spectacular beauty that moment , and their families before that all the abstract knowledge is in an amazing honor recognized the rabbi and see me . I used to teach you is true . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call themselves as we call lies over , we are in the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
and people say to the original 土族 风土人情 we think about that Russell noble 野人 old legends that an ideal racist Thoreau we think about these people , more than we close . 
it will not 多愁善感 Aboriginal people would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
malaria in the prevailing 阿斯玛 刺骨 wetlands , in the wind of Tibet and how many have this kind of rough terrain , but they are on land , just in the power of creating passed on the miracles , it &apos;s not because they consciously recognize this with very sensitive intuition , and they think the world , because of the human mind absorb the essence of nature . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can , for a living in the Andes children teach young adults , and he said , there is a mountain 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them . they are completely different category them with the environment and 生养 of a different relationship , and in Montana , as a young man is just a bunch of rock can use to open 采石 mine . 
whatever it is a mountain shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is important for the meaning of the relationship between people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to be the deforestation . 
this idea , one with a tribe , they become friends , two groups of people because they believe that these trees are the eyes of heaven and 胡克神 eat the avatar 精灵 people in the world in Hama north they would tell a bar mitzvah with these 精灵 which 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these culture create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this picture last year I was in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
dead on the water is not the amazing is that it &apos;s amazing medicinal sex and is that it &apos;s processed by actually two of the matter is the one hand , it &apos;s a 藤本植物 咔 啉 蓬 硷 β -- and then when you sit down with small amounts of it is on the cane , and you can see a blue smoke it with a wooden 九节 for coffee promiscuous , that &apos;s all in the bush . 
this is a potent of color dopamine , and it in the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 tribe from people with serotonin , plants extract the nose and continuing . 
if you take a powder in these hallucinations , these wacky , you &apos;ll see in a very exciting . 
in reality in front of you , it &apos;s not distorted 荡然无存 
in fact , I was with my mentors Richard Evan shultes the debate in the 1930s , my mentor , in Mexico to find a magic mushrooms are very strong psychedelic . I used to debate , and he said , you can &apos;t put these color dopamine psychedelic belong category then when you sit down , because when they &apos;re working with you , you can &apos;t experience psychedelic . 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
these oral substance dopamine color , to have to change oral 氧化酶 dopamine , and one of the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in 藤本植物 咔 啉 β -- there was going to be able to control and 氧化酶 dopamine to the potency of dopamine color , so you ask yourself , everyone must 
in the bush in the &apos; 80s : 00 a plant that is how people in the form of the plants can &apos;t relate to play together this amazing power of this as a biological experiments in the chemical effect than in all 之和 working . 
we ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask Indians said they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
the tribes 科凡 found the cane is that they all die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to have some plants . 
you know the plants , and I said , is not 
I tell you that if they said in the months circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a question we compassion in some people think they with indigenous life 离群索居 enrich the world forward , but as we develop these people in the back to the edge of history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , people will not of the war , or it of technological innovation , and we &apos;ll remember this era of positive , on the planet to the ecological and cultural diversity of mass destruction , or passively accept this situation where now still didn &apos;t change . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians , even though it &apos;s still with the Indians interest and the horse and carriage courtesy of life is still in the United States . 
the threat is not intact race or change technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
look at the world around us , you don &apos;t have a culture is destined to extinction of the original rich people living with the power of rape them out of 生养 they feel uncomfortable for them , whether it &apos;s 伯南 ceaseless energy heartland of deforestation and forest is the Southeast Asia , 游民 tribes we pull them or to free and roam and pick up for life in the woods and has now for 沦落 仆役 and prostitutes called water , you can see , it seems to be available to live half of the 罗族 南中国海 冲走 to Japan , where people will have to go to cargo ship from the forest and cut down the circle of wood and Jamie 亚诺马 tribe , because there were people gold . 
we look at in Tibet recently , where I do a lot of research , where you can see the authoritarian political brutal . 
and by the genocide denounce the same race , culture , but it &apos;s extinct destruction people lifestyle crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of praise by strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with 
and I was a young colleagues from China Northwest 成都市 go after six : 00 miles southeast of Tibet journey through to when I arrived in during during the time to really understand what you &apos;ve heard about the statistics of hidden behind the Cultural Revolution in the 6 : 00 temple by the largest backbone Communist Party 120 million people were killed . 
this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
the Chinese immediately , he was killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together to Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
and he was only two of his mother , his quietly in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
because his sister behavior , and just by the 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the face of 臂章 and being in the country for seven years of 劳教 . 
the pain of Tibet hard for people with mental redemption human need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead before she had said in the most worried about is because we &apos;ve come into this kind of their native worldview , we only see the human imagination into more 陕 隘 thinking community , and one day we waking up to forget the world there are other possibilities . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve drained 60 . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
time 新石器 into agriculture , human revolution , we would like to these seeds Beijerinck 腊 萨满 poetry is the rabbi . we &apos;ve created for all of this 社会分工 level 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society will only last 三百年 history . 
I think this brief history , we have enough to have the ability to the challenges . 
and when we asked different cultures of the world of the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully species that we have to know all that prosperity 昌盛 race , and all of life . 
I was in this picture was taken up in the northern part of the 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family fear of his security he took all weapons and tools . 
you know , the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the advantage of the day , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he slept in his outside of the skin . he 长裤 to shit faster shit until fingers stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust after he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
off the skin dog made out of 挽具 he accesses the dog sleds and condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t put that in a knife shit on the ice . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of indigenous 顽强 life becomes real . 
1999 four months of government to Canada than the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions , New Le 
this is a independent of where they control all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do to fix it , and the relationship between people . 
and I think that ever some remote areas in the world people actually remote not there . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids to the world is part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we believe that politicians don &apos;t . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about it can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click on a website of thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
we &apos;re going to do is through a series of race , and we take the journey of the audience to see a culture of what they &apos;re going to see everything they can &apos;t help but feel powerful , and we hope he pollen more inclusive and to bring these cultural anthropology , is that the core of the world need variety of ways we can actually live in a multicultural world all the wisdom of all species , to make it of human well-being . 
thank you . 
the Y aguera blaise arcas photosynth demo of this stunning , the software that could change the way we watch digital images from the . pick static photosynth created stunning photos , the dream , and can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
first of all , I &apos;m going to use the fastest speed show you some new technology of basic research . it &apos;s a year ago , Microsoft acquired our company , and we for Microsoft with this technology , it &apos;s a software . seadragon seadragon environment , you can use it or 近景 vision to browse the vastness of data visualization . 
we see here is -- and gigabits lots and lots and lots of bytes 千兆 level of our digital photographs , and they can continue to zoom in , the full by the way , and they go to rearrange them . 
no matter how many of the data , see images , and how much of the images , have seadragon of processing capability . 
so most of the picture is taken by digital camera , but this is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the Library of Congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just , you &apos;re using the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I gave you that this is really text , images , we can do this , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s going to read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more , and this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a did , starts . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself is the ratio of images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy the joy of reading . 
here we do this in a small change issues to &quot; The Guardian corner . 
we fiction a high-resolution picture of the common than that -- you see the normal advertising high resolution , a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way to avoid the actual use of the screen . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window , and this information . 
obviously , with this technology , digital maps is one of the obvious . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made their own . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and with overlaid on the road map of the United States . 
now , we put these , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go to experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging technology : two different . 
one is seadragon , and the other , from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely computer vision of what the research . this research , Steve seitz Washington University . 
and Microsoft Rick Institute of szeliski . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
in this project , we &apos;ve got on the Internet , it &apos;s based on technology seadragon building . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way to look at pictures , and to do more nuanced and have at the resolution to experience . 
these images , but in the space is actually a very meaningful . 
these images visual computer algorithms to connect together , so these images are going to be true to space , and in this space , we took these pictures -- these are the Rockies , in Canada , and pull grassi 西湖 . lakes of the pictures -- here is the . so you can see here is the elements was full of hope , or MRI , and the content is all in space . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of the more interesting than this space . 
so let &apos;s look at last summer , and we use a database of early noah what one of the early photosynth model . I think it &apos;s definitely the technology we 抢眼 . this technology , not just like we show the website that simple . 
because the website , we made a lot of respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
here is the Flickr image on the site of Paris Notre Dame . you &apos;re going to do just Flickr input website “ ” Notre Dame in Paris , and then you can see a lot of pictures , including the photograph alleys , etc . , all these orange color represents cone to build a model . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by 串联 in this space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would work for Microsoft last 
this is pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see the these images from a lot of different camera phone camera , from a single professional to the . so a lot of different quality in this picture , in the built environment . 
let me get some more weird . 
see , a lot of pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here -- should have a series of photos , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster of the environment . 
the point here ? is effectively , we can use the Internet community . we can start to get everyone to different data of memory , collect together to build models . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all . 
this model , however , what is the whole planet . 
it &apos;s like , &quot; The Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , you will be on in . 
if people are willing to all of these Notre Dame 圣贤 in that tag on who they are , that we can all picture Notre Dame , rich , and we can start to in this picture , into this space , this by a lot of people in pictures , and the virtual world across a model , across the user interface experience . 
and of course , that all of a valuable and what is a very rich model -- this is interesting every corner of the landscape . these landscape , not just in the air and satellite images , but really people pressing the shutter 一刻所 collection of the collective memory . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
software . this is the real meaning is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this is the process of 接合 based on the content . 
the more exciting is that contains images of semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type , on the web to have a lot of with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , the image with you ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s incredible ! you congratulate . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist in a society to the Western 施瓦茨 principles -- the freedom of choice . it started in 施瓦茨 more that we have more freedom , and makes us paralyzed . they have become more joy , we bring more not satisfied . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to from a of principles . 
what kind of principles ? 
that &apos;s the Western industrial society by not 笃信 a credo . 
this is faith say this : if we want to get people to make the welfare of the way , is to maximize to individual liberty . 
the reason is free , with this stuff is good , to value , for people . 
and once people have freedom , we can use 做主 way of getting the benefits , people don &apos;t have to for 做主 . 
the freedom to be a way that &apos;s the selectivity of . 
the choice of the people , more free , more and more freedom , which benefits . 
I think , like the idea , so that when you add it into the water in that age-old that nobody wanted to ask questions about it . 
and the same deep embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples look at the development of the progress of society , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say ingredients salad here . 
I have the ingredients salad pronouncement 175种 supermarket , there &apos;s the first 10 different would have specialized sign 榨 olive oil and vinegar grapes 12 balsamic 选购 , if you let that happen to be 175种 salad sauce and all of you , you can use them hook to another a large number of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , this is the supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional stereo system -- a speaker , CDs , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s the one in a three-dimensional stereo system is countless more . 
with this store , you can components of 650万种 close with a combination of three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and Maya to a company , just that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually died at the phone , it &apos;s not all bad . 
that 一去不返 already days . 
now I almost infinite variety of mobile phone , especially . that . 
these are the cell phone . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , a French and cut hair forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next seen shops , don &apos;t have to worry about , not how you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : you have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , the answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in some other lives more than shopping for us , and the effect of the Big Bang . 
health care -- not in the United States , right now is that you go to the doctor , who tells you how to do so time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth , and make a nail . risk . 
and so forth , and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
doctors said these are very nail , again , risk , and make those 乙 and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you have to me , that you chose ” ? 
they said , but I don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
the result is what we say “ patients municipalities . ” sounds like a pretty good . it to do is to bear and responsibility , from a know how to do , I mean , 转嫁 to a treatment , and that &apos;s what require , not to do in the state of people , that &apos;s the patient . 
now the recipe , all the ad is for you and I of the ordinary people . and if you think about it . just say , if we can &apos;t buy directly to the counter . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call the doctor , on a prescription drugs in them . 
now , we like the gender of the identity of this thing into a choice . it &apos;s like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we can to shape of their gender . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of men and women are the decision . 
in marriage family , everyone in the past age is to take for granted that is almost got married , and then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
you need the choices , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a smart and good students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they students than ever before . stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself , what am I going to get married or not ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to kids , and I knew business ? 
this is the 脑筋 problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they do not do I work , whether they get in my class a grades . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can any one time , in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except hotel 夫 . 
but , in this restaurant , you can have a place of wireless online , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
we say , the incredible work that we have freedom of choice is the choices we need to make decisions , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about . 
we went to see a soccer kids 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 BlackBerry and with the blackberry lap , and with the laptops . 
even if they closed , we are looking at the same rivals for the kids and ask yourself , this is not the phone ? 
back to or not ? I don &apos;t have this email to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no child , you know , this is the experience of the game is big compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big of matter , it &apos;s way of life , life is . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still , but nothing is not to have choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the problem is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these choices , there &apos;s two people , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we have . it &apos;s not , but inside , is paralysis . 
people with so many choices that very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan pension for investment in terms of research . 
one of my colleagues had access to record . in the vanguard vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about millions of people and two , 000多个 office . 
she survey found is that when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every increase of 10 to reduce the number of two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it &apos;s even more difficult , so you can put and tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow , Tomorrow &apos;s halide , of course , you would never tomorrow . 
we know it means that when people to retire , may have only use 充饥 dog food , because they don &apos;t have drawn enough money to the future , and decided to do , because it &apos;s so hard to even employer , that they are fairly impressive . it &apos;s all for a grant symmetrical . give up . 
not to this plan for a year , they make up from subsidies symmetrical employer 5千元 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so many possibilities , choice is the result of paralysis . 
it makes us into the world looks like this and this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose a wrong fund , or salad ingredients . 
thank you . it &apos;s the first negative . let &apos;s talk about the second , even though I in trying to overcome rigid and paralysis and finally made a right , we decided to make decisions and we can choose sexual 少时 more decisions . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
so , one of the salad ingredients species , if you buy a , think about , you &apos;re very easy to imagine if you pick a . okay ? this massive influx of choice , and you have to make you feel regret regret , that makes you feel for you used to make the satisfaction of choice , even though it was a very good choice . 
the more choices , the easy thing to some inexplicably feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction of choice . 
and second , is what economists call “ ” opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a enough , we see is a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you give up the choices . it makes you always was chosen for you to think that 美中不足 . 
so , for example , a cartoon that if you New York , I said , a 歉 
but this is what you want to be right now . 
look at this two 口子 Hamptons . 
expensive , rich . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
you can still better than this ? this point in to “ huh , really , bad ” “ ” in August , is now . 
Manhattan “ neighbors are not home , ” 
I &apos;m going to “ is to stop that can go back to my door ” . 
two weeks , and he was a idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the parking . 
the opportunity cost “ ” we always have to make decisions , even with enough to actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things , all the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also said the “ present ” . it &apos;s probably going to do step . 
but , a sense is , when you choose to do something to it , you don &apos;t do it . 
these are the things it attracted a lot of you decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I have to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
jeans , that &apos;s a pattern , you buy , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to washed so many times , pants get 凑合 . 
so , this years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new . I said , I want to feed “ a jeans , this is my size ” . 
and you &apos;re going to say , of the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
to in front of his buttons . it is locked ? 石磨 wash , or is it ? 
to quickly that grinds them ? 
and back , and the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw almost off . and I got over , I said , I &apos;m going to “ that was the only ” a pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I spent a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a I never 合身 pants out the store . 
I do not really wrong . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse reason is , because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a much better jeans , what should be raising a good expectations . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans is a so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least the economy is a perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I got I had to , and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives , together , except for things that can really improve people &apos;s expectations of other people don &apos;t have many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not understand this . because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this in it , in all the bad things are better than now . 
when one of the reason is that people could have good experience to some surprises . 
now , in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you would expect . 
what you &apos;re not going to be , because you know what I than expectations of God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
this thing , I didn &apos;t 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 is not necessarily a bad thing . 
and finally , buy a 合身 jeans and not one of the store is , when there &apos;s only a pattern can buy , you think you don &apos;t happy , want to know why , who is responsible ? the answer was clear . the world is responsible . what do you have to do ? 
now there &apos;s hundreds of jeans shop for you , you buy a back , not happy , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
and out there on the jeans hundreds of excuses , you don &apos;t make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good . to disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and explosive growth in clinical trials , depressing . 
I believe that if the suicide explosive growth and an important , is not the only important factor , but it &apos;s all of those people is the disappointing . why is the standard is too high . when they have to explain these experiences what &apos;s going on , they think it &apos;s wrong of their own . 
and finally , the net effect is objective , even though we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this brought to the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice no choice , but can &apos;t predictions are that the more choices . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ ’ we choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many choices , is a matter . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world that we , at least , we heard a few of them , where it &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic of modern Western societies , a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 said yesterday indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated choice to not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not from ago . 
if we create these social to this system of choice to get out of people now to choose not enough to society , not only can get the lives of people there , we get the same quality of life . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of us , like the plague of choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a wise man , of this fish , huh “ know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have -- I first saw this painting is read it . 
but I want to feel this fish , obviously the know for sure . 
if you want to be honest , because everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is , is the paralyzed . 
everyone needs a “ ” fish . 
and this is a fish . so , for this fish is small , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish and that means to be suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
“ from the digital world , we can create new life ? ” Craig Venter . he said , the answer is ” “ can and will soon . he introduced his recent research promise and very soon we will have created the ability to activate a chromosome . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects about the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code in biology , to a new design , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the small components . 
now we have almost 20 years to use it to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from the analysis of biology , computer September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s for a genome of the species in the lab to replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes that we 一百组 separate out of these . 
but when we look at it metabolism , this is actually relatively simple relative . we believe me , it &apos;s simple . but when we look at all that we can separate , one of the genome , it &apos;s hard to believe it can create a living cells . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these synthetic chromosome is that we can change it to continue part of the most basic questions . 
so we started to walk along the way we can “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in the exponential speed . 
the ability to write our genetic code to progress very slowly , but also to increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it after several . we do the first trial ago , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline of the process , the more than that , the more it wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first Phi X 174 , from the phage genome and digital information . 
kill bacteria is a small virus . 
we designed it genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
and the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t live chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with some oil industry , and I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
but we still want to expand . we want to make the entire bacterial chromosomes , a symbol of 580 , more than 10,000 genes code . and we think we should be in the size of viruses make ” “ box that they can we change these “ box ” to understand a living cell components is actually ? 
design is very important , and if you start to use the computer . that digital information to the digital information . 
when we first in 1995 for this group of subjects , gene sequencing every 10,000 is a fundamental mistake . 
we found , actually , on average , back in sequence is 30 . if we use this sequence , the genes can never be . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the other 50 symbol of pieces of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
we have one of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids amino acids , and this is a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments bias enzyme . some enzyme , to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to make 24 and character of length of time and time getting out , and at a time . 
in a phase , we grow these fragments , so we can give them -- because we want to create a very reliable process , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we try to get automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology , to repair DNA , it can put together than 
here &apos;s an example of a tolerance called microbes 球菌 radiation to withstand 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s everywhere nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , put it back together again , the before . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes to be completely out of water . they can in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and life there , there &apos;s a new environment , the water . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is what the yeast , and the way we design and put the yeast . they talk to automatically . 
this is not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a microscope . look at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the trial . 
this is more than 580000 character of genetic code . this is set by humans and structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font , print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do a very simple more complicated . 
we like to deal with this really nuclear biological and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in a different cells , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , the chromosomes 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant cells chromosome from one to another to activate the cells . 
the microbes from a species we extract chromosomes . basically , it &apos;s the difference between humans and mice . we add some new genes that we can choose those chromosomes . we all get down to enzymes and proteins when we put it into the cells of very amazing happens when you should be like what we make very sophisticated show -- images . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this just that . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process to design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species or chromosome , the third place in the thousands and thousands of seconds , a new features to its own . 
people were held in the process of evolution and just a genetic change ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes is to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of cells that didn &apos;t and enzymes , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
that &apos;s it , and recognize the other &apos;s chromosomes , it &apos;s to digest , and we have a have new DNA . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in a very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all disappeared , and completely into a new species , we put on the new software “ ” cells . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is that we actually implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
I think some of the reason why we need to do is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from the 65亿 into nine billion 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world &apos;s three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , in four . 
we provide 65亿 for food , clean fresh water , all the fuel medicine , very difficult . 
that &apos;s nine billion people to change 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature . it can replace or whatever , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material in the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now have found from around the world in a database of about 两千万组 genes , and I just love them as the future of design components . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry , and look to components that can get diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because they can make we call the mixing “ ” group of synthetic quickly . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a chromosome . 
when you think that it 两千万组 different genes , and try to optimize the steps that create drugs or 辛烷 制剂 , and new vaccines , and we can change , even a small team , can do better than the last 20 years of science have done more molecular work . 
and this is standard . we can choose to survive , the ability to produce , the fuel or chemical production , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is , we actually sit in the computer to really design species software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
recently , you will see into corn ethanol is just a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
but we think the only biology can make a huge impact and not limited to increase the food . it can use to is that if we can start using CO2 as a material of it . so we &apos;re designing a new cells development in this path . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide is a way -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to collect their very convenient , then , they can be introduced into , with fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; understanding of basic questions . 
we replace the whole oil industry a little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where ? there can be a major source . 
and we also use the same tools immediate made out of vaccines . 
you can all of this flu , we &apos;re always going on in time and a year , the lack of money , when the vaccine . 
I think this can be a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species have such an artifact for the bacteria , nuclear is really the biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a far away and improve human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough time , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
the estimated 09年 TED in this short talk , Brian Cox which shares some super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
last year I speak at TED , the LHC . 
and I said to update it back to talk about the machines running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in the universe reinventing the billionth of a second state per second , and began to make a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the ground in Geneva 
we use these little changes to probe the Big Bang . 
this is my work on , ATLAS . the inaugural detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around the LHC along the way we , as part of the LHC with plans , in a lot of particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see the 10th of September in this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know this . this is also 满堂喝彩 -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work with the culture that were on the science of it . 
but about a week later , we machine out of a major with these 导线 导线 about -- the Golden Desert . 
and when they conduction 导线 安培 current all machine . 
now some of you might say , engineers , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 planet than the temperature of the space between these 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 of 接点 on a technology for a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to a little bit more of the transmission it suddenly current 安培 by resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnets up the material they move about a mile constructed . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
they have to work , unloaded has accomplished . 
we give them out , it &apos;s good . 
now , back to wait for them . 
in about three of refer to be the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data , and we find out the mission of the most basic of the universe . 
now , obviously , so one of these accidents back about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think this task , but we still too difficult for the fact that the projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
and I want to 复述 戴维翰 warren , a British scientists , and I remember him as an apprentice myself in defense of meaningless -- he &apos;s an apprentice , Michael 法拉 -- said , for the human brain development , nothing more dangerous idea : think we have to understand science as a mystery of everything the human has been so 全胜 and stop to explore . 
thank you . 
for those incredibly great social often contemporary art , thanks to the creator itself , and people for a genius , unusual squad . Elizabeth Gilbert for this to explore and thinking , 独到 for creating genius : that &apos;s a guy with a genius , ” “ than he or she in creativity , the genius “ ” help . this talk , vivid interesting 令人感动 personal color , and of inspiration . 
呵护 . Elizabeth Gilbert talk about creativity and creative reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was obsessed with with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , a specific event recently , but in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
this particular event is : I published book that the latest 回忆录 , the &quot; love , and pray that this particular event is : I published book that the latest 回忆录 &quot; beauty , and pray , &quot; I love the work of those very generic as big , somehow into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller . 
now , the result is whether people , and I think this is the result is that life , and whether people , and I think this is my life . 
so , really , really , saved , 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very anxious , said to me , and you don &apos;t “ of ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
you don &apos;t “ . you &apos;re going to write this life forever , and also the work that don &apos;t love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever , and also the work that don &apos;t love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever , and also the work that don &apos;t love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever , and also that don &apos;t love ” work ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was very difficult to date , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , I decided to become a writer that day was very difficult , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , decided to become a writer . I was a teenager , I met around the same question , people say , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
I met around the same question , people say , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of going to collapse on you ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid to have it for a what ? you not afraid to have it for what ? you into the broken dream of going to die in despair , with the pain in your final broken dream of despair , died in the center of failure . 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the center of failure , and I was always get question . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
actually , except that , I was afraid of a lot of people don &apos;t think that this actually , I was afraid of a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? 
what &apos;s creative work , that &apos;s how we worry about mental health for each other ? creative work up there , and that &apos;s how we worry about mental health for each other ? it &apos;s not a other industries , this is not ? 
for example , my dad was a chemical engineers chemical engineering 40 years , in his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he was a chemical engineers chemical engineering 40 years , in his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he was a chemical engineers . 
nobody says : “ meet John , chemical work ? bottleneck ” ? 
could never ask this happened . 
of course , that engineers , chemical 平心而论 groups , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism global 享誉 狂躁 and not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 down the writer , and we have indeed that not only the writers , in the field of creative people seem to have emotions , not very stable 恶名 fields writer , creative people seem to have very stable 恶名 . 
just look at the early in the last century , with great geniuses 英年早逝 just look at the early in the case of a century , the field with great geniuses 英年早逝 is often the case before died . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent . 
the 曼梅 , died in the last time I said , in every book “ all 蚕食 ” part of me . 
life &apos;s work for you , this is how the radical . 
but we wanted to story 视若无睹 见怪不怪 , because we already , but we wanted to story , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 视若无睹 and somehow , people are totally accepted . in this idea is this idea : creativity and pain , and creating art that will be extremely 苦闷 : is this idea , pain and creativity and creating art that will be extremely 苦闷 
today I want to ask you , you are not exceptions to that ? I want to ask you , you are not exceptions to that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in 
not only that , and terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
not only that , and terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want to have this idea that the next century , and not terrible 可憎 , I don &apos;t want this idea of up to the next century . 
I think we encourage the great geniuses continue to be alive . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I believed that I will inevitably , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially in my career so far . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of career 
and probably , from this moment , I write a piece of will be used to a book and I was an incredibly tragic event of to compare , isn &apos;t it ? will be used to a book and I was an incredibly tragic event of to compare , isn &apos;t it ? 
and frankly , we can see in this talk , I said , quote , &quot; and the friends , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , this is what the idea . 
is this idea , people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s not the way back , is this idea , people on a 大清早 drank -- not the way back . I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
after a deeper , in my opinion to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for the responses from anxiety writing itself , and I had the response . 
for a year ago , I can see , in history , and find out in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and find out in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and find in different cultures , to see if they have better , more than we rational to help the idea of what art is 艺术工作者 processing of emotional risk to help 艺术工作者 art with what &apos;s the emotional risk . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because the last would go back to us . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a kind of sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks called in common with this kind of creative for 精灵 stewards for “ ” 
and people often think Socrates there &apos;s a stewards for that gives him , from a common wisdom was that people think there &apos;s a -- Socrates stewards for wisdom gives him from a distance . 
the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent wonderful this view of Rome , because people don &apos;t think “ ” genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
they think is a wonderful ” “ genius of the sacred , and they even think “ genius ” artist living in the walls of the studio , like little 精灵 than they genius even think “ ” artist living in the walls of the studio , like little 精灵 than they would come quietly , invisible to help artists , and they &apos;re going to work on 成败 drilling quietly , invisible to help artists , 成败 work . 
this is amazing , this is that I was looking for is to make this safe distance from people who work on 成败 psychological protection . 
we can understand it , it &apos;s not ? 
by this ancient artists , and get protection of the ancient artist narcissism by this idea to protect , and get narcissistic too . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a glass of genius “ ” work done . 
if you work really bad , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you genius “ ” very bad . 
this is in the last Westerners for a long time about creativity . 
and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea , and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea : “ , let &apos;s take a human heart , in the universe beyond the gods ” “ mysterious and unknown , let &apos;s take a human heart , in the universe beyond the gods mysterious and unknown ” and no space for the gremlin who will deliver sacred . 
this is the beginning of humanism rational , people start to believe that all creativity comes from human rational individuals itself , and this is the beginning of humanism , people start to believe that all creativity comes from human rational individuals itself , and this is the beginning of humanism , people start to believe that all creativity comes from the human beings . 
the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” called , artists , and not have a “ ” genius 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
for one person , a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , and create the source of these things , and with the demand for fishes , he swallow the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
this is a completely distorted the cognitive self , and for people to expand the achievement was completely that of a distorted cognitive self , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of get an artist , I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of devouring artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least I think this is so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the past , the more they reference for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 ideas of the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
and maybe in the audience today , that people can ask questions and maybe they are grounded in evidence of science in the audience today , that people can ask this question of science , they are grounded in evidence 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous idea that 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous ideas . 
maybe I can convince you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
that &apos;s all the uncertainty of the creative process in this 精灵 theory , and I heard all other theories as to say or and make this irrational 精灵 theory , and I heard all other theories reasonable as irrational as or so . 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you had this experience of the creative process will know don &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
for example , I met the great poet bowhead silk . 斯通 bowhead silk have 九十多岁 , she &apos;s been a poet her when she said to me in Virginia when a life of the things that she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance . 
like a breath of on her face , and the outpouring 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with the only thing she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
she goes home dashed across , this poem after all , she would dashed across her home , this poem after all , and she explained to find the paper and pen , in this through her , capture that poem , put it in the paper that she explained to find the paper and pen , in this through her , capture that poem , put it in the paper that she explained to find the paper and pen , in this through her , capture that , it &apos;s a poem written in the paper . 
sometimes , she wasn &apos;t fast enough , crazy , she didn &apos;t home , and the poem and Pentium already , so she would miss that poem , crazy , she didn &apos;t home , and the poem and Pentium already , so she would miss the poem and she said , it will continue to move between in fields , looking for a poet ” “ down , and she said that will continue to poem swimming in fields , looking for the “ ” a poet . 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part , and she said she there are almost 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running home pen and paper , looking for a poem that she went to go through about it , she doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and that &apos;s a poem , and she went to go through about it , she doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and she &apos;s the other hand , it &apos;s her tail , and the other hand , grab that poem tail . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the beginning , by the word , to go after the first word . 
just sequence is upside down , from the last word go by , and the first words , I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s incredible , the creative process , and I ! I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , the creative process . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not my creative process , I don &apos;t all of my work , is more like a so . 
and of course , it &apos;s not all of the creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I way of working more like a day , so I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work every day , I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get the idea of an accident , but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get an accident . 
in a lot of people might have similar experience . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on ?

it &apos;s not work , he still is completely dark . 
but when he from creative genius , to pull itself with creative process , the challenge of anxiety , but also , when he put creation from genius , to pull itself with anxiety of creative process , it was the inspiration is going to challenge , and that &apos;s just painful , it is 倒像 liberated 原处 back , and he realized that , he would have thought of itself in inspiration , torture .

the interesting thing is , when Moore &apos;s Law 野史 invasion of southern Spain , and they brought this practice interesting 野史 Moore &apos;s Law empire is , when the southern Spain , and they brought this tradition and a few centuries , change , and the 颂词 from Alabama “ ” , Alabama , you know , you become “ 嘞 嘞 ” and a few centuries , change , and the 颂词 “ from Alabama , Alabama into ” “ 嘞 嘞 ” you today , you know , you can still in 斗牛 competition and 弗拉明 戈 喝彩声 heard of it . 
in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of : all are cheering you on your way to you , Alabama “ 嘞 嘞 , you know , really , really great , great , that &apos;s ” miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 artists to wake up , and the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 wake up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning that is , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old , and he might mortals couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe we will not dance , when he was all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should from ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most of my self cognitive one .

you 嘞 ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists think is worth more than the predictions about , and that for his ” “ clean coal . 
for Al Gore recently : climate . 
last year , I show you two of the polar ice cap 三百万年 it in the last demonstration of South America by the equivalent of 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but these are not exactly this question of , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
it , the polar ice cap -- just like the global climate system of the heart . 
in the summer , and actually hyperextending heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s in the dark blue every winter , and this is a form of the Year in the summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing permanent “ ” form , is five or more of ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood to 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of being was freezing . 干冰 of carbon and clean microbes defrost , methane , carbon . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey professor walter 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s OK , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a melting of the year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is a river kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising here is the mouth of the Nung it . 
here is a dramatic rise in traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest ice in himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
from 40 percent of the world for the water -- half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice drinking water . 
in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent less every year . 
and this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry big number . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of 七十五年 four times more early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we increase the ocean every day CO2 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
look at the east to west America from the Pacific region in India on the continent times and dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , in addition to burn oil is 20 percent of the fuel . 
oil is important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
this is what has and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what reminded me . 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee dig muck coal of billions of dollars . 
you probably saw on the news 
here , the second largest put the water . 
in this before Christmas 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
Mr. cool coal is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see the more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
coal cool in every day and become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s west virginia , where a lot of coal . 
the most is the head of the coal mining massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy companies , and CEOs of energy in the company was in the environment and the laws of a controversial issue , the process of extraction that didn &apos;t take the mosquito 污 . Al core of , and now 议长 nancy pelosi congressman , Harry Reid and energy and business committee chairman congressman . and by the two people to Congress a composite of the energy bill climate , these guys don &apos;t know they &apos;re talking about ? 
so , climate protection and block is one of the current , and we launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of coal mining and version of the truth . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean the smell . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at the art as clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal global warming is one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
look at it . this is now clean coal technology . 
this is a solution to national security and economic challenge . 
in the U.S. national security and economic crisis , the climate crisis 
all these crisis strings together is based on carbon oil on the dirty like import oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
with 100 percent repower america clean electricity use 10 years . 
the new work life , we get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america know more . 
one last 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet is that we reduce the fastest way on it . 
in the future . here , the wind , solar energy , new network . 
investment to create a new kind of work . 
has repower america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
graduated from MIT , David 梅若 we showed siftables -- cookie , you can use my hands , the size of the computer building blocks together . it can be toy advanced arithmetic , playing music , . it would be a new generation of the learning machine ? 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about play as you &apos;re in the building blocks . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re learning how to solve problems . and this is to understand and 空间结构 objects . 
understand very 空间结构 objects around to help us learn a lot of things . 
so , as a computer scientist , in this field hand-powered inspired by the way , and in my partner and I pattie kalanithi affordable , I started thinking about -- is that we can use a new computer to move the mouse cursor , a digital fingertips in desktop move -- that ? how would we can use to hand , sensory information directly to our ideas to combine information -- that would ? 
and so the question of sitting in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable , sense each other , each other and siftable 每块 monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- digital tools of information . 
this individual more tools , more sensitive to each other , sensory perception , any subtle , so we can use this interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
they &apos;re typing a siftable it like this , if I put it side to it , so that &apos;s in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they out a 挨 , a really interesting phenomenon is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , they &apos;ll also aware , that would have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other and perception . 
we found an interesting interaction through some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables , like a liquid that down from a color to another pour siftable siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s three in the bucket paint siftables , we can put these bucket pour the color of the middle of color , which together . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions to learn to see , on-the-spot faster . 
this is I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- is that I made a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this word together as a game , you just take a piece of the alphabet with siftable with dollars , and when you put together siftables letters of the word , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later automatically siftables spell on the right word that change the sequence of words , right , you can try to put the new in other words . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , the screen some kids are in the Media Lab siftables experience in the test of kids , I took experience . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
he &apos;s going to just say , this is a “ ” together words , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables experience in other people . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just wanted to siftables of together . 
in his mind , is just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the child Felix . 
he can put some new graphics to add elements , what he did was to the table siftables towards pick up some graphics , you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he put it to the Sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
now , David he put it in . 
in orange . 
do good . 
put siftables to shake graphics that can bring new elements to this add up to his new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how plan , his story . 
the balloon sitting off . 
and I &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function in , playing music is even more recently , we developed , siftables in the function of sound , like a drum and 超载 note , and the sound . 
everybody has tiles that 四档 modulation , 任君 choice . 
you can put sound of the modules siftable to sound editors tiles siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a sound filter , 响器 with the siftable module . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume edited tiles siftable to adjust the tiles siftable rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two editors 超载 into modules , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles tiles Drums , that can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to need to accelerate the pace of tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now to put sound filter , Bessel tiles filter tiles . 
in the process of playing music , we can also . 
so don &apos;t need to play , but even in advance , all based , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with play , the tiles volume edited tiles on the left , to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium computer-human interaction with better human brain . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we developed a new generation sophisticated technology -- and the digital media 接轨 technology to bring the world , it &apos;s going to change this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
