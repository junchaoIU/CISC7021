through rapture purpose photos and stories , the National Geographic explorers by Wade Davis celebrate the Aboriginal cultural extraordinary biodiversity , that &apos;s an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me , traveling around the world and in the human studies of one of the most fun is experience that didn &apos;t forget the traditional some live to be in touch breeze rainwater wash 晶莹 light stone had with the taste of bitter lobes , you can feel their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 tiger going across the context of the Inuit the myth that still notion of empathy , or in the Himalayas Buddhist or in following 法门 that remind us of anthropology at its core ideas responsibility is that we live in the world is not in an absolutely consciousness , and it &apos;s just a reality is a model for sexual choice , and our ancestors in many generations ago we make that choice . 
and of course we all follow the same sort of flexible rule . 
we are now born to 母腹 and in the world 生儿育女 
we have to go through the adult week of 
we have a 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance in 排遣 life 苦楚 we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find each songs rhythm and dance rhythm , has unique . 
whether we &apos;re living in the jungle Krishna 伯南人 or Haiti voodoo teach 侍僧 or Northern Kenya Julius Sue 武士 mountains , desert 安迪斯 巫医 or the middle of the Sahara desert account hotel and I had with the people 结伴 to the desert , he &apos;s a 牦牛 牧养人 life at the top of the world Everest hill . 
all of these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now 
if you think you can now send the thinking that makes you see the future . 
the world 五彩缤纷 cultural 犹如 by mental life and culture , a life of the cover the entire planet Earth 芸芸众生 it for a very important meaning , as we call the biosphere as important as the net . 
you can put it in a culture of the web as a race loop loop this race can be defined as a human since self-aware shrouded by imagination to create all the ideas and dreams , myths and all 之和 intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , and we as a very strong exploring species . 
as the biosphere , all of the same race , and also facing the same shorter and its destruction faster . 
no one can say a 50 percent or more species extinct , or at the brink of extinction , because the truth isn &apos;t biodiversity of the most pessimistic . and also rather than the diversity of the most optimistic . 
this one of the most important is that language . 
we live on this planet that has 6 : 00 different languages . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is the human spirit , shining 
it &apos;s the unique culture spiritual matter in the material world 承 carrier . 
every language is a kind of a conscious mind with a mental ecosystem long-term precipitation and accumulate 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that and we all numbers at the same language there is no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that unless we effective rules and they &apos;re going to totally disappeared . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you just last say 本族语 where people can &apos;t tell our intelligence and allowed to predict the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
another spooky is on the planet , about every two weeks . it would have a 仙逝 to be accompanied by a ancient language . 
I know you people will say that wouldn &apos;t it be better ? if you only have a language that &apos;s not better ? so I &apos;m going to say that the only language is Yoruba or 粤语 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I &apos;m going to do is take you to explore the race ethnic loop loop give you a rough and make you personally feel are lose civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people have forgot that I mentioned “ different being ” I said “ different being ” 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 Northwest Bala the rabbis . they &apos;re called 蚺 that the race because they believe in a time that they &apos;re from 米尔克 river coming out of the sacred about snakes . 
the groups of people can &apos;t tell the difference between blue and green because the forest is their 栖身 of so in their 天穹 the forest canopy and no difference . 
and they say , a strange language and follow some rules that 通婚 called linguistics 异族 通婚 one to the people with a different languages , married people . 
this is based on mythology historical lineage . you can see a strange phenomenon , because the wedding 异族 of a very often have 六七种 language you never see someone 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
when I was working with the genocide in Ecuador northeastern 华拉尼 people is one of the most amazing race in 1958 , I used to that they had peace friendly . 
five missionary 1957 years to approach them , but these people who made a fatal mistake . 
they get in the next eight to 10 十张 they himself . we think it &apos;s kind of , but they didn &apos;t think that live in water regulation by rainforests of the people who &apos;ve never seen a two-dimensional . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images get over to try to find these people coming , but they found nothing and they think this is a call to Devil cards , so they use with 戮 dead that five missionary 
more of that is not only external 华拉尼 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is by their own people 戮 dead . 
we investigate some 一个八代 宗谱 found only 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the same old being able to go to wood , they will die and 送终 戮 for him . 
the other hand , they have a forest 惊诧 revealed . 
their predator can smell 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I used to take a fantastic job I professor from Harvard asked me if I have to Haiti to dive into a secret club that &apos;s Haiti president 杜华利 and his regime for high base of the professors allow me to go there and access to a used to make 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand it . I have to figure out what this mysterious religious voodoo taught how voodoo teaching is not a dark and the . 
and this is a complex 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some important in the world of religion can give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam Buddhist and other things that religions . 
there &apos;s a continent still forgotten so many people think that sub-Saharan Africa , not a religious this is not right in the great famine era that part of the stray around the world of religion to there and voodoo teach it &apos;s the essence of these religions . 
voodoo unique about it is living with the connection between . 
living in the spirit . 
the rhythm can tap dances to 大水 below the soul just replace living soul in this brief shining moment 侍僧成 for God . 
so voodoo who like to say you go to church worship to call God . 
we were to be divine cathedral . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach 侍僧 into a evident trance state of de-animation sudden burning branches , but worse for wear when they enter extreme of state of hyperactivity , you &apos;ll see more startling fact that makes you feel resilience . 
when I was exposed to all of those groups of living in Colombia north of the mountains of 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization them once conquered and in the region Columbia plain since they go back to the isolated mountains of a plain . 
in this bloody ethnic globe continent that has never been Hispanic to conquer . 
and today they along 续 the monk to rule , but they monk 训诫 very different . 
and there &apos;s only three , young 侍僧 is taken away from their families had gone in the darkness of the world , on the bottom of the stones into the house for about nine years of age 十八年 is two , and it &apos;s a metaphor for 40,000 fetuses in utero during the 怀胎 in September . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain these values , and the relationship between the believers with the universe , we can call it the balance . 
until they age , that magic of the first time they found out the sunlight hut see on the ground present mind-blowingly spectacular beauty that moment of a sudden , families that they had learned all abstract knowledge was an amazing honor of recognized the rabbi . me see I used to teach you is true . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call myself lies call over , we are destroying the world . 
this is the ability to create a very important . 
said 土族 citizens and the original 风土人情 would we want to Russell about the noble 野人 old legends that an ideal racist we think about Thoreau these guys more than we close . 
indigenous doesn &apos;t 多愁善感 wouldn &apos;t tolerate 思乡 of torture 
in malaria , the prevailing 阿斯玛 wetlands in the wind 刺骨 of Tibet and not many this kind of rough terrain , but they rely on land . just in the created out of the miracles , it &apos;s not because they consciously aware of that , and with very sensitive intuition , and they think the world are , because the human mind , the natural essence . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can , for a living in the Andes of adults grew up with , and he said that there is the mountain 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them they &apos;re a completely different people with the environment and 生养 of a different relationship , in Montana , one of them is just a bunch of rock that can be used to open 采石 mine . 
whether the mountain is shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is really important for the relationship between the people with nature . 
I was in British Columbia , grew up in the local people &apos;s thoughts . I think is going to the forest was cut down . 
and that makes me a tribe , and one of my friends , has to be two groups of people because they believe that these trees are 胡克神 and heaven of the eye of the avatar eat you 精灵 in the north end of the world in Hama tell a bar mitzvah . they &apos;ll with these 精灵 which 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures to create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this is a picture of me this past August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
dead on the water and the wonderful thing is that it &apos;s not magic medicinal sex and is in the machining , it actually made up of two things on the one hand , it &apos;s a 藤本植物 contain β -- 咔 啉 蓬 硷 and small amounts of To phantom then when you sit down and take it on , and you can see a blue smoke it to something called the 九节 carpenter coffee , or from all the bush . 
this is a potent the color of the dopamine it with brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
亚诺马 rice tribes people from a serotonin , plants extract this substance , and continuing nose . 
if you use a nose swallows the powder , you &apos;ll see these wacky hallucinations , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you are not twisted but 荡然无存 
in fact , I used to my mentor , Richard Evan shultes debate about in the 1930s , my mentor , once in Mexico , finding a magic mushrooms are very strong psychedelic . I used to with his argument that you can &apos;t take these color dopamine belong psychedelic category then when you sit down , because when they &apos;re in your body is working , you &apos;ve never experience psychedelic . 
but these color dopamine matter doesn &apos;t oral because they &apos;re going to be human organ of something called the single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
to oral these color dopamine matter and have to change this oral 氧化酶 dopamine in the other chemical . 
what &apos;s interesting is that there &apos;s the 藤本植物 β -- 咔 啉 alone can suppress the dopamine 氧化酶 and play color of the power and everyone must ask yourself , you . 
in the woods has : 00 species , where the people how to find two in the form of plants can &apos;t relate together to play this amazing power this as a biochemical experiment with various ingredients produce chemical effect than all the ingredients clearly 之和 
ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments keep making errors , but found nothing . 
but if you ask Indians they would say that the plants will speak . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribal person found the cane is they all die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask , how are they gave these plants hierarchy , they say , &quot; I want you to plant some research . 
you &apos;re not for plants to know what I say not 
so I told you that if they said in the months circle of this 17 plant of every plant will pay different the Greek to you sing . 
that &apos;s not going to get at Harvard Ph.D. , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem and some of us sympathy with indigenous people think they 离群索居 enrich lives , but as our world forward . these people stepped back to the edge of history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , one of the wouldn &apos;t it happened during the war , or its technological innovation and will remember in our time on the planet positive , about the ecology and cultural diversity to mass destruction , or passively accept the situation now where still didn &apos;t change . 
and all cultures have been by a new way of life , the strong . 
this is not technology . 
called the Sioux Indians even down with it is the Great Sioux Nation Indians and Americans goodbye horse and carriage lives and the United States . 
the threat race intact is not change or technological innovation , but power is otherizing idealism . 
look at the world around us , you don &apos;t have a culture is destined to extinction of the original affluent energy people being raped power out their 生养 of made them feel uncomfortable for them , whether it &apos;s 伯南 heartland ceaseless energy in the forest and cut down or Southeast Asia , we pull 游民 tribe , they also free and roam and pick up the generation to live in the woods and now has 沦落 for 仆役 and prostitutes called , and you can see the water soil heavy seems to put the 罗族 half 南中国海 冲走 to live in Japan , people are ready to go to cargo ship carrying from the forest and cut down the circle of wood and 亚诺马 rice tribes , where the gold people flocked there . 
let &apos;s look at the Tibetan mountains recently where I do a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same denounce genocide cultural destruction , which is the destruction of the crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of their praise strategy . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with that . 
I met a young colleagues from China Northwest 成都市 go through 6 : 00 miles southeast of Tibet journey through to when I arrived in during during the time to really understand what you &apos;ve heard about the statistics of hidden in the Cultural Revolution 6 : 00 a temple by the largest 120 million people were killed where backbone molecule . 
and this young man father 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 
the Chinese invasion immediately after he was killed . 
his uncle and other believers displacement to Nepal . 
his mother because 富农 family , and then when you sit down is locked up right here . 
and he was only two his mother quietly put him in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister because offended behavior , and by the 学习班 
one day she accidentally step to India &apos;s fur chairman of the 臂章 and being in the country for seven years 劳教 judgment . 
the pain of Tibet elusive redemption through the human spirit need access to witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead in before he once said to her most worried about is because we &apos;ve come into this kind of their native worldview not only are we going to see the human imagination into more 陕 隘 thinking community and one day we waking up to forget the world there are other possibilities . 
we &apos;ve back in the world for 60 drained that makes us feel guilty . 
新石器 age revolution , the human into the agricultural age , we would 腊 seeds of erotic 萨满 poetry by rabbi . the for generations we create a level of 社会分工 that only 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society is only nearly 三百年 history . 
and I think this brief history was enough to have the ability to solve the air for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
when we went to the world &apos;s cultures ask about the meaning in life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility : a fully conscious species to realize that we have to make sure that all race and all 昌盛 to live a life of prosperity . 
this is a picture of me in the northern 巴芬岛 up . I was with some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals , this is called 奥拉雅 people tell me about his grandfather &apos;s legendary story . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government doesn &apos;t do the Inuit , to build our sovereign we get them to the settlement 
this man refused to move grandfather . 
his family worried he was safe to put all of his weapons and tools are taken away . 
you all know the Inuit , always cold , which is their days , the thick . 
their sleds across the street in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of fish , it was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he &apos;s slept in the outside in his seal leather 长裤 he put a stool to hand until shit faster stiffen , he made it into a blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust and then he used this and I &apos;ve dealt with having a dog . 
off the dogs bark into a 挽具 he accesses made out of dog sleds condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t that the manure of in on the knife . 
this is really 空手 artificial life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , in the world of all indigenous 顽强 becomes real life . 
1999 four months Canada to an area the size of California and than Texas 之和 larger land returned back to the Inuit , 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the New Le dimensions , 
this is a separate territory they control , where all the ocean . 
this is a very good a country can make a difference to repair and its people . 
and finally , I think that ever this world , some remote people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids , is the world , a part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through a National Geographic and TV can do is we believe that politicians don &apos;t . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about it can make the world , so we can get change the world &apos;s best at about the fact that we click of a month to three of these five million 
we 156 channels in a country play 
we have millions of people magazine . 
we &apos;re going to do is through a series of race to the journey of our audience to see a culture of what they see is that they can &apos;t help but feel powerful , and we hope he pollen more inclusive and to bring these cultural anthropology at the core of the world need variety of ways that we can actually live in a multicultural world to the wisdom of all species for all of human well-being to make it . 
thank you . 
blaise aguera Y arcas did this stunning of photosynth demo , the software that could change the way we watch digital images from the . use pick a static image , photosynth created in a stunning vision , and we can navigate . 
blaise agueray arcas photosynth . 
first of all , I &apos;m going to use quickly show you some new technology of the research . it &apos;s a year ago , Microsoft acquired our company , and we for Microsoft with this technology , it &apos;s seadragon . seadragon is a piece of software , you can use it to 近景 or vision to browse the vastness of visualizing the data . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of our digital photographs , they can continue and smooth , through the larger context to browse them , and they could rearrange them . 
no matter how many of all the data , images of big and the images themselves , seadragon all have that kind of processing capability . 
so most of the images were made by digital cameras shoot , but in this case is different , it &apos;s an image from the Library of Congress scan images , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not different , because of limited system with only one thing only : you can use of the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image . 
this is Dickens &quot; desolate 山庄 , &quot; which is a chapter three . 
I &apos;ll show you that this is really text , images , we can do it , you can see that this is really text , not a picture . 
maybe it would be a read a book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
and here &apos;s one more example , this is an The Guardian . 
every did here is a opening . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading experience , to enjoy reading . 
here we are doing a small change in the Wired The Guardian to corner . 
we make them up a high-resolution advertising than this image -- you just see a normal commercial resolution you are , in the picture into the content . 
if you want to see this car , and you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
in this way to avoid the size of the actual use . 
we hope that this technology can reduce the window to be thrown like garbage information . 
obviously , with this technology , digital maps is so obvious , one of the applications . 
and yet , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we have to make a difference . 
these were just at NASA geospatial images . 
on top of processing and get it in the United States road map . 
now , let &apos;s put down those , look at other . 
in fact , this online , and you can go and experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other , is at the University of Washington graduate noah snavely that computer vision study . it &apos;s got Washington University , Steve seitz 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski help . it &apos;s a beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied , it &apos;s based on the seadragon technology building . 
you can see , we easily for images to multiple ways of looking for images , is able to do at much more nuanced and have resolution to experience . 
but , these pictures , at the three-dimensional folding is actually a very significant . 
computer vision algorithms to these pictures together , these images are able to take real space right , and we &apos;re in this room took these pictures -- these pictures were all in the Rockies , pull the 西湖 and lakes grassi . near the -- all in this picture is taken down . so you can see here is the element of any show , or full imaging , and the content in space are correlated . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of examples of this place it . 
and let &apos;s take a look at last summer , we use noah early database of photosynth models of what the building , which I think it &apos;s our technology , the most 抢眼 . it &apos;s not just like we on the web , showing that simple . 
mainly because we build websites , respects Posse Comitatus restrictions a lot of law . 
here is the Flickr website images of Paris Notre Dame . you can do is , Flickr website input “ Paris Notre Dame ” and you can see a lot of pictures , including the photograph alleys , etc . , all of those orange color represents a cone to build models . 
these are all from Flickr photos , by this by 串联 in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would last for Microsoft . 
by this , it was exhilarating . 
I think you can see that these images from a lot of different from the camera , from a cell phone camera into a single against , so a lot of different quality , is in this environment , put together . 
let me get some more strange pictures . 
see , some pictures visitors contains the 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here is a sequence of images -- ah , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to the poster , to see the whole of the environment . 
so the important point here ? is that we can work with the community . we can learn from each person is going to get to different environmental memory collect together , to build a model . 
and all these pictures intertwined when a much more than just to take all of them . 
this model can menacing , is the whole planet . 
and it &apos;s Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth &quot; long tail market . 
this kind of model , people use it to be complex , become more valuable . 
pictures of , you will be in the tag . 
if people are willing to die for all of these Notre Dame , the 圣贤 in the tags , who they are , and our Notre Dame picture is a rich , and then , we can , in this picture as a point , you enter this space , this by many images can build a virtual world , and a across model , across the user interface . 
and of course , this is another precious product is a very rich model -- is that the Earth every corner of the interesting landscape . the landscape , not just in the air and satellite images , but the real people pressing the shutter 一刻所 collection memories of its parts . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right now , you &apos;ll be in the years to come from that global picture 接合 together ? 
yeah . in this software , actually , is to explore . 
it &apos;s in the image of building up a link . 
this 接合 process is completely based on the content . 
even more exciting is that image contains a lot of text semantic information . 
for example , you go on a picture , type word , page text is going to have a lot of with this picture . 
now , all these images with your picture , that would be like ? 
now , so the semantic information , connectivity and the capacity to be huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , just incredible . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist in 施瓦茨 for Western a central principles -- the freedom to create . in 施瓦茨 seems more didn &apos;t make us more freedom , let &apos;s get paralyzed . they become doesn &apos;t make us feel happy will bring more unsatisfying . 
Barry 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
and I want to talk about this book part of the content hope it and you &apos;ve already heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I think one of their faith . 
what kind of creed ? 
that &apos;s the Western industrial society 笃信 not by a credo . 
the tenets it : if we want to make people get the benefits , the way , is to make personal free to maximize . 
and the reason is free , stuff with itself is the good and valuable , for people to . 
and once people have freedom , each of us can 做主 with all the way the welfare , don &apos;t have to get people for 做主 . 
free to make a lot of ways that the increase selective . 
people , more and more freedom , freedom , the more the benefits that the more . 
I think , the idea , like so that when you add it into the water in that age-old that nobody wants to that question . 
the same ideas are deeply embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples look at the social progress development have let us be possible to do something . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to talk about the salad ingredients . 
I have the supermarket 175种 pronouncement salad ingredients , there &apos;s the first 10 different sign would have specialized 榨 olive oil and vinegar 12 balsamic grapes any 选购 , if you happen to that 175种 salad spaghetti sauce , is not your taste , that you can use them hook and a large number of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , this is a supermarket . 
and then you turn out to be a one stores configuration that a three-dimensional sound system -- speaker , CD machine , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a one store three-dimensional sound system would have a lot . 
with this store components that you can have a close 650万种 all the combination of the three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
I was a kid was , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , which had to go to Maya Bell company , just this one . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually , it &apos;s the phone to die , they would not bad . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
now I &apos;m almost infinite phone species , especially the mobile phone . shows . 
these are the cell phone . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same with an MP3 play , a nose cutting hair and French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you &apos;re not in your next to the store seen , don &apos;t worry , not how you would see . 
this thing , people running into shops asking : you have a not so much of function ? 
you want to , say ? 
the answer is no ” “ . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in life , the other than shopping more to us and the effect of the Big Bang . 
the health care -- in the United States , right now are that , you go to the doctor , who straightforward tell you how to do era . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment nail , can also use 乙 . 
which is very nail and so forth and risk . 
I have a solution 乙 and so forth and risk . how are you going to treat ? 
and you say , “ Doctor , how do I do ” ? 
they say that again , nail has these effects and risk , 乙 have the negatives and risk . 
how are you going to treat ? 
and if you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re going to be me , that you chose ” that ? 
they said , “ , but I &apos;m not ” you . 
and the result is what we call the “ patients municipalities . ” sounds like pretty good . it &apos;s actually make decisions . bear and responsibility , from a know how to do , I mean , 转嫁 to a treatment , and that &apos;s what we don &apos;t require , can make decisions in the state of people , it is the patient . 
now the prescription for pharmaceutical ad all , that you and I of the ordinary people . and if you think about it , it &apos;s just say , we can &apos;t go straight to counter buy . 
why are we doing to their marketing campaign ? 
the answer is , they wanted us to look at the ad , the next morning , go to the doctor , and they put on a prescription drugs on them . 
now as our gender identity and have a choice . like this slide to try to convince you of that . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we could get back to shape their gender . 
this is every morning you woke up after you have to get to today , you want to do a kind of people and men and women of making decisions . 
in a marriage family , in the last everybody to age is married and almost for granted , then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices and who are married , not what you see , it &apos;s not married later . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of good and bright students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework for almost one . 
it &apos;s not because they were students -- stupid , it &apos;s not because they &apos;re not so hardworking . 
the reason is that they &apos;re brains are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself , what am I going to get married , or not to marry ? should I now ? 
and then they ? I was first child , and I knew things ? 
this is 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they do not do I work , whether they in my class and take a grades . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can in one day of any time , in any one corner of the Earth -- of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but this in restaurants did have a place to WiFi , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
and we work with these incredible choice freedom to us is we had to choose to make decisions , again , again , again , and now to work and to break moved . 
we go to the kids play football , a 裤兜 the mobile , another 裤兜 in pretend BlackBerry and blackberry , lap and holding laptops . 
even though they &apos;re locked up , we are watching their kids in rivals for , and to ask myself , or you don &apos;t pick the telephone ? 
or you don &apos;t go back to the email ? what should I shouldn &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no , you have children , and it was a ball game experience is still severely compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big , substance or lifestyle , life is choices . 
we live in the world . 
that means , choice is still there , but not all nothing to choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the question is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s a bad thing . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , it . we have is not , but inside , is we numb . 
with so many choices to people that decision is very , very difficult . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a peer-to-peer pension plan investment in terms of research . 
a colleague of mine came in contact with vanguard investment , vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million people and two , 000多个 office . 
she survey found is that when the customers and their employees -- the helps fund increase of every 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to 50种 fund , people than you five fund , down 10 percent . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it was even more difficult , so you can put it &apos;ll come back tomorrow . 
tomorrow &apos;s major tomorrow , tomorrow , tomorrow , of course , you would never come . 
we know what it means that when people to retire , may have only use dog food 充饥 , because they don &apos;t have drawn enough money to the future , and make decisions , because it &apos;s so hard , that even employer for them . that &apos;s a very strong symmetrical for a grant are not use quit . 
not to this for a year , they make up 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so , choices , possibilities of the result is numb . 
it makes our world looks like this and this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you must really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose that helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
and it &apos;s the first -- so negative . and here &apos;s the second , even though I in trying to overcome rigid and paralysis and finally made a good decisions , our own decisions and we can choose sexual 少时 decisions more happy . 
there &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
one is , so many salad ingredients species , if you buy a , think about , you &apos;re very easy to imagine if you pick another . and what happens ? this idea of a massive influx another choice , you know , you &apos;ve made a decision to feel regret regret mood , that you were to your choice , happiness , and , even though it was a very good choice . 
choice , more easily inexplicably for something to feel regret . this is one of them , it &apos;s not happy with their choice . 
and second , is what economists call “ opportunity cost ” . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert told a enough is , we see a thing of value , depending on who we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot to think about , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you gave up the choice in many ways , and that makes you always right you see the that think 美中不足 . 
let me give you an example and show them , and if you are not New York , I have a 歉 . 
but this is what you should think about things . 
look at the Hamptons those two 口子 . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have it . 
it was better than ? this point in to “ huh , really bad , ” “ is now in August , ” . 
“ Manhattan of your neighbors are not home , ” 
I &apos;m going to be back “ can to stop to my door ” . 
and two weeks , he was such an idea torture , every day in 念叨 lost of the good parking . 
“ opportunity cost ” always let that we &apos;ve made a decision not happy , even if it actually quite remarkable . 
we have the option in these choices , the more attractive things which of these things and became opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
and this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but one of them a sense is , when you choose to do something , you can choose not to do other things . 
the other thing that tend to have a lot of attract you decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
it &apos;s time I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you buy , pants inappropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in a long enough to time , I washed so many times , pants get 凑合 . 
so , in the years old , I finally street to buy the new . I said , “ feed , I want a jeans , this is my ” size . 
and said , you have to type , the comfort of sweatpants , or the ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
going that fast grinds them ? 
and the , or to the ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw almost off . and when I got over , and I asked , “ I &apos;m going to that is used to be the ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and I spent a 钟头 then all of these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a I place the 合身 pants out the door . 
I do it . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I feel even worse , which is , because there are so many can choose , I was in a jeans exactly what to do good expectations greatly rise . 
I was very low expectations . when jeans was a , I don &apos;t have too much to expect . 
and when they have 100 dimensions , huh , the best at least one of the economy . 
and that &apos;s a really nice , but it isn &apos;t perfect . 
so I have , I had to go and I &apos;d like to compare , and I expect , and this is disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives together , except for people to do what we can actually have a lot of good from bad didn &apos;t give people with many benefits . 
that &apos;s just making people and less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not understand this , because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all this stuff is really bad for everything better than now . 
the reason is , when one of the things that are not good people could experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , industrial civic life in the world , we take for granted , for every one of the things you can only hope it &apos;s not better than you would expect . 
you will never be what was amazing , because you my bad than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , it &apos;s you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so it , I think , let &apos;s take a little bit of time , I married my wife , and she &apos;s a good wife . 
this thing , and I didn &apos;t 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 doesn &apos;t necessarily a bad thing . 
and finally , isn &apos;t 合身 jeans , and one is that , when the store , there is only one patterns . you can buy , you can feel happy , want to know why , this imperative is who ? the answer was clear . the world is responsible . what do you have to do ? 
now the store , there &apos;s hundreds of jeans for you , you buy a back , it doesn &apos;t , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer is : you . 
you can do better . 
right there in the hundreds of jeans , you don &apos;t have any excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach of good they are so disappointed to -- to blame myself . 
in our past generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and the clinical depressing disorder explosive growth . 
I believe that explosive growth in and suicide an important , is not the only , but it &apos;s important factor , which is all of those disappointing . why is the standard is too high . when they have to explain these experiences what &apos;s going on , they think it &apos;s their own been wrong . 
and the net effect is , although objectively we do better than ever before , but it is not as before . 
I remind you . 
and this choice about the well-being of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no doubt have no choice , but can &apos;t abandon picture choose more is better . 
there &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond ‘ choice we rich ’ what is the critical value . 
I said . here is a policy question , we have a policy question is , for our industrial society so much choice , of matter very much . 
the world , and lots of places , at least , we heard a few of , where it &apos;s not too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern wealthy Western society , a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday said , indignant , the question is , we make those expensive and difficult to operate the car seat 于事无补 , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to talk about is the expensive , complicated choice to not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us as before . 
if we get to the society , to create these options out of the system to commit to the now people don &apos;t have to society , so not only the lives of people there can be improved , our quality of life is also improved for . 
this is what economists call 帕累 and improve . 
product redistribution to everybody , not just the poor , life better , because we got rid of the pandemic , like us out . 
the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a wise person came position , “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have a -- I first saw this painting , that &apos;s reading . 
but I want to the obvious that it was fish must know something about it . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the happiness . 
you have increased was paralyzed , and reduced is satisfied . 
everyone needs a “ fish ” . 
in this fish -- so , for this fish is small , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish , which means that suffering is going to , perhaps , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
we can “ from the digital world in creating new life ? ” Craig Venter said . his answer was “ can ” and it &apos;s going to happen . he discusses his latest research and promises very soon we will have created activate pair chromosome . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I have to talk about this project , part of the human genome , and their meaning . and found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re working on digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to the digital code to a new design biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to come up with some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists to try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the components . 
now we &apos;ve spent the last 20 years to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from a biological mimic analysis of the world of September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can build any life , or whether we from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the genetic sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s for a species , the smallest genome to make it in the lab self-replication . and we &apos;re trying to figure out whether we could find a smaller genome . 
we can from 500组 genes in isolation is our 一百组 these . 
but when we look at its metabolism , this is actually relatively simple relative to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple , but when we look at all that we can separate out at the genome , it &apos;s hard to believe that they can create a living cell . 
so , we think the only thing that can continue to research is artificial synthesize that genome that we can change its components to continue for the basic problem . 
so we started along the way we can walk “ synthetic chromosomes ” ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosomes , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
our digital life in an exponential rate and speed . 
we write the genetic code , the ability of the progress and very slow , but also in the increasing . and what &apos;s going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact after several . when we did the first trial ago , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out that synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
we have 十几万台 device in the little pieces of DNA , in about 30 to 50 character , and this is a step back , the more fragmented , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is the first attempt , from Phi X 174 phage genome and the digital information . 
is a can kill bacteria with a virus . 
we designed this gene , the error correct , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
and the most exciting period is when we put this didn &apos;t have to live the chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles and back to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with the oil industry , there are some , I think they have a model to understand really well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually software can in a biological system , build your own hardware . 
but we want to expand . we want to make the entire bacterial chromosomes , a more than 580 and character of length of the genetic code . and we think we should be in a virus , the size of the box ” “ , make them so that we can change the “ box ” to understand a living cells actually components is ? 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that digital information to accurate . 
when we first in 1995 for this gene sequencing , for the standard is every 10,000 basic for a mistake . 
in fact , we found , in order to , on average , it &apos;s 30 mistakes . if we use the sequence , that set of genes can never turned on . 
design part of the work is 50 character of length of time and the other 50 character long footage of the time to build smaller units . we need to design , they can together . 
one of the design of the unique part . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these 三联 of the body -- and these scripts way about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , and we don &apos;t use it for a poem . 
we designed that and use enzyme which cuts bias . some enzymes are used to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from 70 length of time to put them together make 24 and character of length of time and time getting out , at the time . 
at every stage , we had a lot of culture that we can give them precise , because we wanted to create a very reliable process in a minute , you &apos;ll see 
we &apos;re trying to achieve automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very large images from more than 100 , 10,000 fundamental right , they &apos;re hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern molecular biology tools , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred recombinations biology to repair DNA , and it takes time together 
here &apos;s an example of microbes called resistant radiation 球菌 to be able to withstand 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the images , its chromosomes in different places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it has to go back and combinations of before . 
we have thousands of microbes that can 
these microbes to be completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum 
I was completely convinced that outer space there &apos;s life , and , in a new water . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
there &apos;s a we made this molecule microscopic , through this process , which was mentioned yeast way and put it in the right after we design . the yeast , automatically and aggregates . 
it &apos;s not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope to look at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the recent experiment . 
this is more than 580000 character of genetic code . this is by humans setting structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font , to print out . and you need 142页 to print the genetic code 
so how can we get a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple , with a bacterium is much more complicated . 
as we deal with this belong and relatively simple , you can take a nuclei and into another cell , that &apos;s what you heard about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they &apos;re supposed to the cell 连成 one , but we also know that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to another cells and activate it . 
we go from a population of microbes out of the chromosomes . basically , it &apos;s the difference between humans and mice . we added a new set of genes that we can choose those chromosomes . we use enzymes to split them to get rid of all the proteins when we put it into the cells , . pretty amazing you should be like we &apos;re making fantastic images -- . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought that just breaks . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosomes species or from other parts of the third side of the chromosomes , in one second of the thousands and thousands of new feature to its own . 
people were held in the process of evolution , and that &apos;s a genetic change the perception of ignoring the creation of a lot of it . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzymes are digesting the DNA . 
out of the cell chromosome no and without this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
they do it , and recognize the other chromosome is no matter , it &apos;s to digest , finally , we have a have new DNA . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the species that we were all gone , and completely into a new species , we put the cells “ ” new software . 
all the proteins are changing , membranes and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , effectively , we will implant . 
this may seem like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not genesis -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do that ? 
I think for some demand for us to do that is very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world would be the three people in every single one of us from 1946 is ; in the next 40 years , it turned into four . 
we &apos;re for 65亿 of people , clean fresh water , medicine , the fuel is very , very difficult . 
which nine billion people that &apos;s 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 coal , oil . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is the material around the world of the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we now from around the world , there &apos;s a contains about 两千万组 gene database , and I like to see them as the future of design components . 
electrical industry , there &apos;s only 10 to components , and learn from that diversity . 
now , our main limit from the biology of reality . and our imagination . 
we now have this technology , because they can build what we call the mixing chromosomes ” “ group of very synthetic . 
what we have the ability to build a robot that allows us to make a million chromosomes a day . 
when you &apos;re thinking about processed this 两千万组 different gene , and try to optimize the steps have 辛烷 or create drugs 制剂 , and new vaccines , and we can change , even a small team , can do better than the last 20 years science history have done more in molecular biology . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can start survival to choose , chemical or the fuel production , the production and so on . 
this is a screenshot . the whole thing is that we actually sit at work in the computer really to design species . 
we don &apos;t have to know what it looks like that . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on “ 第四代 fuel ” . 
you see the recent corn ethanol is going into a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third fuel . it was sugar into higher value of the fuel like 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
but we think biology can make a huge impact it doesn &apos;t grow food . and it can be used by the way is that if we can start using CO2 as the ingredients . so we &apos;re designing a new cells that make this a viable . 
and we think in 18 months , we get our first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and CO2 is one of the ways -- 
so it -- but we know from the world to discover that , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes , 1996 by about them . 
it lives in the deep sea . about 1.5英里 deep , almost in boiling water temperature . 
it put CO2 into methane hydrogen molecule is the source of energy . 
we &apos;re looking at whether we can put their collections of two really , really convenient , they can be a process , into the fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; , the fundamental problem . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry , the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there ? to become a major energy . 
and we also use the same tools made out in vaccine . 
you see this year of flu , we &apos;re always going on a year and lack of money in the case that when the vaccine . 
I think this is through a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , have such an artifact for the last belong and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better farther away from human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure we can have a chance to live to long enough , maybe you can do that . thank you very much . 
in this 09年 TED estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox shares some which super Collider news . , what &apos;s going on , and the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
last year at TED , I introduced the LHC . 
and I said , it must have come back to update what &apos;s the machines running . 
and here it is , if you &apos;re not going to last year , the LHC is in the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second , when you make began per second , and a state . 
so much more ambitious . 
this is in Geneva underground mechanics . 
we use them to little photographing the Big Bang . 
this is my period of work on , ATLAS . detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is atlas building process . you can see a spectacular scale . 
last September 10日 we first started this machine . 
this is a atlas shine down . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of all the way down the LHC , as we all plans and part of the LHC , a lot of particles in 辐 go detectors . 
in other words , when we see in September the 10th of this picture , we know that this machine works . it &apos;s a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know this is a 满堂喝彩 or is this -- when people go to Google , see if the icons like this . 
this suggests that we work on this with the culture of research on the same . 
but about a week later , our machines out of the main point with these 导线 about -- the gold 导线 
these 导线 conduction more 安培 when all the current . 
now some of the engineers amongst you might say “ impossible , these wires ” too little . 
they can do because when it very low , they become the superconducting 导线 
so in minus 271摄氏度 below the planet in the space of these 导线 can conduction so strong electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a 接点 there is a set of technology mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rises a little bit more to it transmission of 安培 current and their resistance 
and that &apos;s the result . 
very shocking , because the magnet weigh up to 20 tons they move about a mile rule . 
we have about 50 magnet impaired . 
to put them unloaded , which has done . 
we gave them joy . it &apos;s good . 
now , they come back into the ground . 
in about three of being called back to the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data and continue our mission to figure out the form of the most basic . 
obviously now , one of these accidents , again , so about cutting-edge science and engineering , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we projects in pursuit of itself , which is the LHC value . 
and I want to 复述 a British scientists 戴维翰 warren , and I remember him as an apprentice meaningless experiment defense -- his master &apos;s Michael 法拉 chapter -- said , for the human brain development , nothing more dangerous idea : think we have to understand the science of it as a mystery is something we &apos;ve so 全胜 and stop to explore . 
thank you . 
and for those of great art , the social often get the creator itself , people and for a genius beyond unusual , . Elizabeth Gilbert for this to explore and think , ask for creating genius 独到 : think of some guy &apos;s “ genius ” , than his or her in creativity got “ genius ” . this talk entertaining and personal color , 令人感动 and full of inspiration . 
Elizabeth Gilbert 呵护 . about creativity and helped create stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was with with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , I was with with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently in my life work , there is a specific event , however , recently in my life work , there is a specific event that I have to rethink I and my job . 
this particular event was : my most recent publishing that 回忆录 the food and pray , love , &quot; that particular event was : my most recent publishing that 回忆录 the food and pray , &quot; I love those very generic work much different , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller 
it turns out , and now you and I think , people all my life as a result , now you and I think , people all my life like this . 
really , like this , completely , saved , 完了 ! 
they would be very anxious , came to me and said , “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
“ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this life forever , but you don &apos;t write about love work ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this life forever , but you don &apos;t write about love work ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this life forever , but you don &apos;t write about love work ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;d be like this life forever , but we also don &apos;t have that love ? ” . 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
my life would be very difficult , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , decided to become a writer . my life would be very difficult , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , decided to become a writer . I was a teenager , I &apos;ve confronted the same questions , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
I &apos;ve confronted the same questions , people say , you don &apos;t be afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of sustainable refused to take you bearing down upon ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid to life , it was a ? you don &apos;t be afraid to life , it was a ? you end up in fragmented dream of dying in despair , with the pain you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the center . 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair , died in the failure of self , I was always get questioning , etc . 
and the question , simple answer is : “ ” . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
yes , this kind of everything scary , until today . 
well beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that many people think of that beyond that , I &apos;m afraid that many people think of things . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is a cerebral idea ? 
people fear for their own destiny work ? it logical ? people fear for their own destiny job ? this logic ? 
creative work is the thing that makes us for mental health worry about the creative work ? what &apos;s the thing that makes us for mental health worry about it ? other industries but don &apos;t do this , right ? 
for example , my dad was a chemical engineer in 40 years in chemical engineering career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked him if he was afraid of a chemical engineer in 40 years in chemical engineering career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked him if he was afraid of a chemical engineers . 
nobody says : “ John , chemical work met bottleneck ? ” ? 
could never happened before this question . 
and of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer it just doesn &apos;t in the last few centuries , too much alcohol addiction , depression and 狂躁 享誉 global not in the last few centuries , too much alcohol addiction , depression and 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
not in the last few centuries , too much alcohol addiction , depression and 狂躁 享誉 global and we writer , to actually have that kind of reputation , not only the writers , variety of creative people seem to have emotions , very violent 恶名 not only the writers , variety of creative people seem to have very violent 恶名 . 
just look at the early last century , the great geniuses 英年早逝 in which case just look at the early last century , in areas with great geniuses 英年早逝 cases often is lightly died . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent 
and the 曼梅 , died in the last one interview I said , “ every book 蚕食 all part of me ” . 
and for your life &apos;s work , that was an aggressive . 
but we wanted to story 视若无睹 , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 , but we wanted to story 视若无睹 , because we &apos;ve already 见怪不怪 and somehow , people are completely internalize embrace this idea that is , creativity and suffering , art makes ultimately will lead to extreme 苦闷 , this idea is , creativity and suffering , art makes ultimately will lead to extreme 苦闷 
I want to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? I &apos;m going to ask all of you is : you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? if a further away at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in 
this is not only 可憎 , and awful , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century . 
this is not only 可憎 , and awful , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century that not only 可憎 , and awful , I don &apos;t want this idea that up to the next century . 
I think that encourages us great creativity geniuses live there will be good . 
and I myself , believed that it &apos;s put me in the dark , due to , and I myself , believed that matter to me , especially in the dark , due to the stage in my career , especially now in my career . 
you see , I was young , to 40 years old , you see , I was young , 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of my 
and it &apos;s possible , and from this moment , I write a piece of will be used to and I was an incredibly tragic event in a book of comparing , isn &apos;t it ? will be used to and I was an incredibly tragic event in a book of comparing , isn &apos;t it ? 
and frankly , are we all talk about that long , and I say , is a friend , and the heart , potentially , I &apos;ve been the most successful . 
Oh my God , it &apos;s kind of ideas . 
is this idea , who took a 大清早 drank -- had no way to , is this idea , who took a 大清早 drank -- had no way to I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
and after a deeper , I think , to keep writing , and I have to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create some psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance from writing itself , and I work for responses from the anxiety from writing itself , and I work for responses from the anxious . 
a year ago , I find that you can see , in history to find , and also in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in history to find , and also in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in history to find , and also in different cultures , to see if they have more than we better , more rational ideas to help 艺术工作者 handle art , what &apos;s the emotional risk to help 艺术工作者 handle art , what &apos;s the emotional risk . 
the search for the last brought me into the ancient Greek and ancient Rome 
so please bear with me , because the last would go back to this problem . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from humans , that in Ancient Greece and ancient Rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from humans , that in Ancient Greece and ancient Rome , people didn &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a sacred of 精灵 distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks common to call this with creativity of 精灵 for “ stewards for ” 
and people often think Socrates that there &apos;s a stewards for , from a distance to give him wisdom was that people often think Socrates that there &apos;s a stewards for , from a distance to give it intelligence . 
the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius , the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called “ ” genius 
this wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful , because the Romans didn &apos;t think “ genius ” is a particularly intelligent personal 
they think “ genius ” is a wonderful sacred , and they even think “ genius ” live in an artist studios walls , like little 精灵 than as they even think “ genius ” live in an artist studios walls , like little 精灵 than they would come , invisible quietly for artists , and they &apos;re going to work on 成败 quietly come , invisible to help artists , and work 成败 . 
it &apos;s amazing , that &apos;s where I was looking for the safe distance , and that &apos;s what makes people from work 成败 impact psychological protection . 
we can understand the business model , right ? 
by the artist that and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic ancient artist by this idea and get protection , averted excessive narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of “ genius ” for the next project . 
if you work a terrible , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is a Western in the last for a long time about creativity . 
and then the Renaissance , everything changed , and people had a great idea , and then the Renaissance , everything changed , and people had a great idea : “ , let &apos;s take a human in the universe , beyond the gods and mysterious unknown ” “ , let &apos;s take a human in the universe , beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown ” never space for the gremlin who will deliver sacred . 
this is the beginning of the rational humanism , people start to believe that it comes from human creativity , individual itself , and this is the beginning of the rational humanism , people start to believe that it comes from human creativity , individual itself , and this is the beginning of the rational humanism , people start to believe that it comes from human creativity , individual itself . 
the first time ever , people will be an artist called “ genius ” , rather than having a “ genius ” for the first time ever , people will be an artist called “ genius ” , rather than having a “ genius ” for the first time ever , people will be an artist called “ genius ” , rather than having a “ ” genius 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
for one person , a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred , creativity , the unknown , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred , creativity , the unknown , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred , creativity , the unknown , and the source of these things with the device for fishes asked him to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , is too big . 
for fishes asked him to swallow the sun , and the vulnerable individual , is too big . 
this was completely down one &apos;s perception , and to make an individual . completely down to this one &apos;s perception , and for people could have done . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artists , I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years devouring many artist . 
if it &apos;s so at least I think , is this so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to see them for human creativity understand ? maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to see them for human creativity understand ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes , question-asking off the 500多年 rationality the human mind , we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes , question-asking off the 500多年 rational human mind . 
and maybe the audience today , you can ask questions and maybe they are grounded in evidence of science today in the audience , and be able to ask the question that they are grounded in evidence science 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous idea 批驳 this fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous ideas . 
well , maybe I can &apos;t convinced you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why not a new way of thinking ? but , I mean , why not ? why not a new way of thinking about ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why not a new way of thinking about ? 
that &apos;s all kinds of explanation of uncertainty , the creative process , the theory , the 精灵 theory and I &apos;ve heard all other theories as rational and or irrational as the 精灵 theory and I &apos;ve heard all other theories as rational and or as irrational . 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you had this experience will know , I don &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s just beyond common 
for example , I see of the great American poet bowhead silk . 斯通 bowhead silk have 九十多岁 , she was a poet and she said she was growing up in Virginia , the country that she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem , from a distance to her and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem , from a distance to her and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance . 
like a on of the breath emptying down at her . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this will 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it &apos;s coming , because this will 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do only one thing , with her , is really to “ dashed across ” 
and she would dashed across home , it will go after her , she would dashed across home , it will go chase down at her , she explained to find the pen and paper , and in this through her , capture that poem , write things in the paper , she explained to find the pen and paper , and in this through her , capture that poem , write things in the paper , she explained to find the pen and paper , and in this through her , capture that poem , it &apos;s written in the paper . 
sometimes she , it wasn &apos;t fast enough and crazy , running , there &apos;s home , it has Pentium and , so she would miss it she crazy , running , there &apos;s home , it has Pentium and , so she would miss it , and she said , it will continue to mass-produce swimming , looking for “ next poet ” , and she said , it will continue to mass-produce swimming , looking for “ next poet ” 
in other , and this is called me the most amazing part : on the other , and this is called me the most amazing part , and she said , sometimes she are almost 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running home , looking for a piece of paper and pen , and it &apos;s going to go through her , but she was going through it , it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and it &apos;s going to go through her , but she was going through it , it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail , and she would take out the other hand , grab that poem tail . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail to get back , the other hand , and will poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back on the other hand , it will poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this time , poems will intact to paper , except that sequence is upside down , from my last word , by and go to the first words . 
except that sequence is upside down , from my last word , by and go to the first word I heard her story , I was like , it &apos;s amazing , and my creative process , the same ! I heard her story , I was like , it &apos;s amazing , and my creative process , the same . 
I heard her story , I was like , it &apos;s amazing , and my creative process , the same ! of course , it &apos;s not my creative process of all , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I works more like a so 
and of course , it &apos;s not my creative process of all , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I works more like a day , so I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work every day , I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work . 
but even 古板 as I , sometimes to get an incredible ideas , but even 古板 as I , sometimes to get an incredible . 
in many of you may have similar experiences . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , even if you want , like me 墨守成规 , will have to know where inspiration .

in Spain , when a performer done some incredible wondrous place for people will all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama , you know , you know , 嘞 嘞 , Alabama , really great , excellent . that &apos;s ” miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn waking for artists , the tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn awake found was a Tuesday morning at 11 o &apos;clock , he &apos;s not miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old mortals and he probably never get to the height of the last night . 
maybe no one in his dance all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing him how to from ?

thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you know , 嘞 ! 
from here at TED , Al Gore shows the new situation , think about climate trends -- more than scientists to worry about , and that he for “ clean coal ” . 
Al Gore for recently : climate . 
last year , I &apos;m going to show you two of the polar ice cap demo in the last 三百万年 in the area of the equivalent of the American South 48 state is reducing 40 percent . 
but that doesn &apos;t exactly show it because it doesn &apos;t mean that it &apos;s thick ice cap . 
it felt , the polar ice cap -- just like the climate system beating heart 
in the heart actually hyperextending . summer heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is in the last 25 years of piece . 
red is a permanent was freezing ice 
you see , it &apos;s in a dark blue here is a form of the Year in the ice in the summer ice permanent was freezing . 
the so-called “ permanent was freezing ” form , I &apos;m talking about five or more of ice you see , it &apos;s like the blood into the body 各部 guy . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that around the Arctic Ocean permafrost 受热 and there &apos;s a lot of being was freezing of carbon and 干冰 . defrost , microbial clean methane , carbon . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be present in the atmosphere , all the global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in Lake already you can see that went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska of katey walter professor 结队 to a light lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s fine , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the sink of heat heat Greenland . 
this is a year melting of the river . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is Greenland southwest kangerlussuaq river . 
if you want to know about the ice is how to make sea level rise here it is the mouth of the Nung 
here &apos;s the traffic is rising . 
Antarctica , the Earth on the other side of the planet , the largest ice . 
last month , scientists report the continents are in the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in himalayas , the third largest ice at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world -- from the water get half of the water . 
in the Andes , the ice is the city of drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent every year . 
for water , this is a . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
the global dry . it is causing the fire population decline . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of the speed . 
in the last 30 years , are in relation to the earlier 七十五年 number four . 
this is a completely unsustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see . 
in the last five years , we &apos;re adding CO2 to the oceans 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
watch the Pacific region from the east to west in India , across the ocean and dramatically reduce 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , except for 20 percent of the oil fuel is burning . 
it &apos;s important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest emissions , one of the two countries , and China . 
the solution was to build a much carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;re already starting to see the change . 
here &apos;s what &apos;s the and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it -- but , in our country has a political war . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry in the last year is spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal . it &apos;s a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of ? 
Christmas , actually , in my hometown of Tennessee out of coal muck billions of dollars . 
maybe you &apos;re watching the news . 
here , the second largest put waste water up . 
this is what happens to the Christmas back and forward . 
there &apos;s a kind of coal carbon industry . 
and the coal cool is happy , happy . 
in the United States , you can see he productive , more productive and he also help us develop economies 
coal cool , every day to become more healthy . 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s west virginia , where a lot of coal . 
most of the top is the coal mining head massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy company . and , in the company of energy is in a legal environment controversy , the argument that mining process didn &apos;t take the mosquito 污 response : Al core , and now 议长 nancy pelosi congressman , Harry Reid and congressman energy and business committee chairman -- so two people to push through Congress a composite of energy and climate bills , these guys don &apos;t know they &apos;re talking about something . 
so , climate of and Al Gore &apos;s work , and now one of the president on two projects . 
this is one of them , one part of the 
in coalergy , we &apos;re very serious to climate change for our careers . 
this is why we spend a lot of money with our initial goal tried to understand and version of coal . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean do . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s look at , like the art of clean coal factory . 
some 喧哗 machine spectacular ! 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal is global warming one of the main reasons why you see the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
let &apos;s look ! this is now a clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
the United States are in the economy and national security , climate crisis 
the crisis is strings together is based on carbon oil products on such as the imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a whole new solve these problems . 
repower america with 100 percent renewable electricity in 10 years . 
the new work for us to live more safe , and make the planet in the global warming . 
eventually , a large enough of the solutions to our problem . 
repower america , and learn more . 
the final 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
the cliche of the dirtiest oil in the murder of our planet , which is to reduce its dependence on the fastest way . 
the future is here . the wind , solar energy , new energy network . 
new investment to create a kind of work . 
repower america . it &apos;s time has . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
graduated from MIT , David 梅若 we showed siftables -- cookie , size , you can use my hands together , the computer building blocks . this advanced toys can be arithmetic , playing music , and you &apos;ll be speaking . it would be a new generation of the learning machine ? 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to think about what you &apos;re as played kit . 
when you idea how to build with Legos and to hands-on , you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . it &apos;s about objects 空间结构 and feel . 
understanding of the 空间结构 really helps us around for a lot of things . 
so , as a computer field of scientists , in this way , by hand , and in my mentor pattie and my partner , affordable kalanithi , I started thinking about -- if we could use a new computer to move the mouse cursor , a digital fingertips in desktop move -- would be ? if we could use my hands to direct sensory information on our ideas to combine information -- that would do ? 
so the question of are sitting in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , therefore it siftables . 
in short , siftable interaction is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
siftables can use my hands just move , 每块 siftable each other perceptions of each other , 每块 siftable and display and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable &apos;s , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information of the tools . 
this tool more independent , more sensitive to each other senses , feel any subtle , so we can use this tool to try something new interesting interaction . 
now , I &apos;m going to show some simple . 
there &apos;s this siftable reflection configuration , if I take it to one side , it &apos;s the picture and goes this way , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put a 挨 a girl , the interesting thing is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , they will have noticed , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can perceive moves with each other . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use gestures and siftables interact , for example , like a liquid that put colors , from a siftable into another siftable . 
if you look at the demo , there are three in paint barrels of siftables , we can put these bucket color into the middle of the colors , put yourself . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and learning machine , I can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions to learn to become on-the-spot , faster that result . 
this is I &apos;m here to show siftables reason -- it &apos;s me with a simple equation of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play together word games -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this together in a game , you just take a piece of a letter siftable , when you put dollars a letter siftables together , of the word , siftables in the dictionary in the automated search words . 
for about 30 seconds later siftables automatically based on the right word spell sequence change that letter , make the right words , you can try to use other letters to build new words . 
so it . thank you . 
so now , on the screen some kids are in the Media Lab in the test siftables experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a “ together words ” game , they know how to do . 
now the screen other people in experience siftables . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of the story . 
he just wanted to siftables stack together . 
in his mind , siftables just kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is that the child &apos;s Felix . 
he could use some new elements into graphics , he does is table siftables pick up towards graphics , which you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he took the sun add up . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now his tractor . add up . 
in orange . 
do good . 
to put siftables graphics can bring forth a new elements to this new elements , he added up -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animated stories . 
hello ! 
this is an open the story , he was planning how stories . 
the cat , sitting in off . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last show this feature to even , playing music is that we &apos;ve developed , siftables that function in sound domain , can make 超载 frequencies and Bess and drum . 
every tiles , had 四档 to regulate , 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable hit you like . 
to sound just the sounds come close to edit module . 
there is something like a filter , which 响器 , like the siftable module . 
this kind of come close to sound tiles can adjust to sound . 
so , can control your rhythm and volume of siftable come close to the editor of the modules siftable to adapt rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two editors 超载 into modules , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now the filter and come close to Drums modules , it can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to speed up some just put tiles rhythm to edit module . 
now , and then bring a voice to turn the filter tiles tiles . 
music playing in the process , we still can . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance , but at anytime editing , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with the volume tiles tiles , on the left to edit this place . 
so it . thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new computer-human interaction medium to fit the human brain . 
today , I &apos;ll show you a siftable , our follow-up study in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we developed a new generation of combining cutting-edge technology -- and digital media 接轨 technology , it will change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
