images and stories through rapture purpose explorers National Geographic , by Wade Davis celebrate the extraordinary culture indigenous people around the world , these cultural diversity of working with remarkable speed disappear from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me to do with travel around the world , the career studying anthropology of the most fun is not forget that one of the traditional experience groups in the breeze , to live by touch the light to wash rainwater 晶莹 publish-or-perish lobes with it . you can feel the taste of their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 directly to the old Inuit across the mythology of that still in the notion of empathy , or in the Himalayas Buddhist 法门 that allow us to the core of the human mind is it that responsibility is not the world we live in an absolutely there , and that &apos;s just a reality of a model for sexual choice in the results of generations of our ancestors that used to make that choice . 
of course we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born in the 生儿育女 母腹 and in this . 
we want to experience showered adult would . 
the brutal 生离死别 to face , so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life in the art that we create . 
but you &apos;ll find the songs of culture , has unique rhythm and the dance form . 
whether it &apos;s the life in the jungle variations of Haiti is also 伯南人 teach voodoo in Northern Kenya 侍僧 or the desert , Sue 武士 semi-serious 安迪斯 in the middle of the Sahara desert 巫医 or an eating-place account around with this one month together , I used to desert , he &apos;s a 结伴 牧养人 牦牛 Everest hoist life in the hillside . 
all these different groups of show us how to survive and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you text now going to be thinking that you see hope . 
the culture of the world by a 犹如 五彩缤纷 spiritual interwoven into life and culture , and the Internet for the Earth is covered the entire planet , it &apos;s a very important 芸芸众生 as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important . 
you can put this culture of life is a race to the Internet as this layer by layer , race , for a human being can have a self through time since the imagination , and all the ideas and dream 之和 myths and all the intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , as we also have the ability to look at the very powerful symbol of species . 
as the erosion by biosphere as severe , faced with the same race , and the end of the destruction , and it faster . 
no a biologist dare say 50 percent or more , or extinct species on the brink of extinction in it , because the truth of biodiversity is the most pessimistic away to most of the optimism of the cultural diversity . 
this one of the most important one is the language . 
in our lives have been on this planet of six : 00 of language . 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
the human spirit flash is language . 
it &apos;s actually a unique culture in the spirit of the world , in this 承 therapy . 
every one of the language that is a mind with a mental ecosystem accumulate and precipitation long-term . 
we know the Earth &apos;s 6 : 00 language and the number of us in the audience in as many of these languages , no longer have to teach kids . 
this is the language , unless we don &apos;t have the effective 传人 , they will be completely gone . 
imagine when you 有口难言 or , finally , you would say , is the one who can &apos;t be 本族语 lineage ancestors predicting the wisdom of kids , and maybe this is the future of how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , is a terrible , about every two weeks on the Earth is going to be one of the 仙逝 is an ancient with the language . 
I know you people will say that you wouldn &apos;t be better if there &apos;s only in the world a better is not that language ? so I want to say that this is the language of 粤语 or a Yoruba 
or is 科基语 
you &apos;ll find , you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore this race to let you layer in a circle , race , and make you feel about to die in personal civilization . 
maybe there &apos;s a lot of people say I forgot the ” “ in front of the different ways to survive . I said , &quot; ” “ different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the northwest 亚玛逊 Landscape Bala multibillionaire called they pull 蚺 in the political race , because they believe that a 米尔克 is coming from the birth of the sacred river for snakes . 
that people can &apos;t distinguish between the groups in green and blue because they are the forest , so they 栖身 天穹 in the forest canopy , and with no difference . 
they say , a strange kind of language and follow the rules of the unique 异族 linguistics 通婚 通婚 called to one of the people of different languages , and got married . 
this is based on the mythology of history and legacy that you can see a strange phenomenon 异族 because of the wedding 六七种 language , a very often , there are people you never see 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to would say , a language . 
I was exposed to the northeast of 华拉尼 many people in Ecuador , is one of the most amazing 1958 , the genocide in the early years , I &apos;ve seen , and they have access to peace . 
five years to missionary 1957 , but they make these people to a fatal mistake . 
from their 十张 eight to leave the air , and we think in pictures of himself , this is the friendly , but they don &apos;t think that these people who live in the water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen pictures . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through of trying to find these people what they found , but it &apos;s coming , and they think this is not a call to Devil . so he did it with five 戮 with preacher . 
it &apos;s not more horrifying 戮 the external 华拉尼 people died . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the death of their population is 戮 by the people . 
we have to survey found only 一个八代 两例 宗谱 natural death 刨根问底 they finally , we create more old people . the truth is , they &apos;re going to be the wooden 戮 送终 for him , he died . 
the other hand , they have to 惊诧 jungle of perspective . 
they can unsporting characters of a 40 to smell urine 开外 animals , and know that &apos;s what the smell of animals , urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I was taking a fantastic job at Harvard University professor , I asked me if I have to go in to Haiti , that &apos;s a secret club with his 杜华利 in Haiti , the president of the support of the regime professor , I went there to make a profit 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand , I have to figure out the mystery of magic and voodoo teach religion -- how teaching voodoo thing is the magic of the dark . 
the opposite 形而上学 , this is a complex worldview . 
this is very interesting . 
if I want you to list some important religion in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
there &apos;s a continent that all forgotten a lot of people in sub-Saharan Africa that religion is not the right in the era of famine , these areas around the world to nomadic people of religion , and they brought to teach voodoo and there &apos;s the essence of religion . 
the unique voodoo , it &apos;s in between the living with connection . 
in living soul . 
the dance 大水 to tap the rhythm of the soul , you can just replace under the birth of the soul moments in the short for 侍僧成 flash . 
so , voodoo respectively worship church to say , you like to call God . 
we have to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach the trance evident 侍僧 into a state of de-animation , but the branches of a sudden worse for wear when they go into a state of hyperactivity extreme , you &apos;ll see more astonishing makes you feel the phenomenon of resilience . 
in all of my life in Colombia in groups of the mountains in northern 科基人 玛尔塔 jihad is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient civilization tyranny of descent , they were once conquered the occupation of the Caribbean , and the coast in plain Columbia since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of isolated in a plain . 
the globe in this bloody ethnic this continent who have never been killed by Spain . 
and today , they will monk 续 along with the ruling , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
and the only three 侍僧 , with the young , they were gone from the family of the glaciers in the dark with rocks on the bottom , to stay in the hut 十八年 nine years of age , and it &apos;s two of the 40,000 fetuses in utero during the 怀胎 in September . 
母腹 back as they have taught the values and support these values , and that is the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
until they age of the end of this amazing when they first came out of life in the hut shine sunlight at the ground are spectacular mind-blowingly families that moment that beauty , they had learned and all the abstract knowledge is in the glory of amazing rabbi and the way to get to see me . I used to teach you really are . 
here &apos;s how it to protect you beautiful . 
they call themselves as we call lies for over the world , who we are . 
this is very important to learn . 
and people say to the original 土族 风土人情 we want to be the noble to Russell 野人 about the mythology of the oldest of an ideal that we would expect , racism Thoreau to more than we are these people . 
it will not indigenous 多愁善感 思乡 would not suffer the torture 
and in the prevailing malaria wind 阿斯玛 刺骨 wetlands in how much of this kind of rough terrain not Tibet , but they are on land , just in the power of passed on the Anthropocene , created this miracles because they are not consciously recognize this and with very sensitive to the world , they think the intuition in itself into the human mind is the essence of nature . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can live for a child in the Andes as adults , and he said , there &apos;s the mountain taught 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them . they are completely different category , where the people with their 生养 of the environment and the relationship with a different in Montana , and the young people , is just as a , you can use to drive a rock 采石 mine . 
whatever it is the mountain gods of the shelter , or just 矿石 that are not important . 
this is a symbol of the important point between people illustrates the relationship with nature . 
in the British Columbia , I grew up in the local people affected by the ideas , I think is going to be the deforestation . 
with this idea of a one and a tribe , has two types of friends who are these trees , because they believe in heaven and 胡克神 the eye of the people eating avatar 精灵 in the north of the world in a bar mitzvah Caesar Hama with these 精灵 on which to them . 
if you look at this point , you &apos;ll find these culture create a different way of life , and you &apos;ll understand how different life . 
this picture in August last year I was in the Northwest Amazon . 
this is 俗称 斯卡藤 阿亚胡 very many people die of cane , you &apos;ve heard about it , it &apos;s a very strong 徒 萨满教 plants , the spirit and made it to die with water cane -- psychedelic drugs . 
the amazing die in the water cane is not , and it is the magic of sexual medicinal machining , it &apos;s actually made by two matter with one hand , it &apos;s a 咔 藤本植物 蓬 β -- the minute 啉 phantom 硷 and take it on the cane is then when you sit down , and you can see a blue smoke it 九节 wood with a name for the bush &apos;s coffee in promiscuous all together . 
this is a potent of dopamine in the color in with the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 from people of tribes serotonin in the plants and extract the continuing with his nose . 
if you use these inhale the nose , you &apos;ll see these wacky powder in the illusion of a very exciting . 
in reality , it &apos;s not in front of you 荡然无存 distorted 
in fact , I was with my mentors Richard Evan shultes debate in the 1930s , the mentors used in Mexico , I found a magic mushrooms are very powerful effects of psychedelic argue , and he said to me , you can put these color dopamine because category then when you sit down psychedelic belong , when they &apos;re in the power to you , you can have that feeling of psychedelic to experience . 
but these oral doesn &apos;t matter dopamine color , because they will be the name of organ for a single change enzyme activity 氧化酶 dopamine . 
to oral these color , and there &apos;s still matter dopamine to the change oral 氧化酶 dopamine in the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in the 藤本植物 啉 β -- there was going to be able to control 咔 氧化酶 dopamine agonists color , and the power to everyone must ask yourself , so you . 
this is in the &apos; 80s : 00 species in the plants that this is how people in the form of the plants can &apos;t relate to play together , this amazing power of this as a biological experiment than in all of the composition of chemical 之和 potency 
we do all kinds of experiments that people are going to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask Indians will say , they &apos;ll say plants . 
what does that mean ? 
the tribes that 科凡 17 . they all cane die in the deep jungle , they found in our species is different . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to study some plants . 
you don &apos;t know about plants , and I said , there definitely is not 
they said that , if I tell you the circle that night in the months of planted in every one of the plants , with different singing to you . 
that &apos;s not going to get your Ph.D. at Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , even though we like some of the indigenous people that they confront compassion 离群索居 enrich lives on the world , but as we develop these people in the back to the edge of history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , people will not remember what during the war , and it happened , and the technology or innovation that we will remember to positive in the era of the Earth for ecological and cultural diversity of mass destruction or passive to accept this situation , where still didn &apos;t change now . 
by the culture of all the time of intense new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
it even Indians called the Sioux with the Indians interest is still in the United States and the horse and carriage sitting courtesy of the United States is still life . 
the threat is not intact circles race or change is itself , but technological innovation , the power of him . 
look around the world , we will find that you have a culture is destined to extinction of the energy that these people were being raped , the power of the expulsion 生养 , they feel their ceaseless energy , whether it &apos;s for the forest 伯南 heartland Southeast Asia , there &apos;s deforestation , pull Landscape 游民 of their tribes to free and roam and pick up the lives of people in there , and now all of the forest for 沦落 already in banks 仆役 and prostitutes side , you can see the water to make it available to the back of the 罗族 南中国海 冲走 to live in Japan , where the people going to have cargo ship carrying out of wood from the forest , and we were to look at the tribes Jamie 亚诺马 that because there were people gold . 
we look at where I was recently in Tibet , doing a lot of research in there , you &apos;ll see some of the authoritarian political . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of the lives of people without crimes by the way , in many places it even denounce as part of the strategy by by praise . 
if you go to where you can feel Tibet with the pain . 
my colleague , and the young 成都市 from China to go through the northwest 6 : 00 miles southeast of the journey through Tibet , when I arrived in during to during the time to really understand that you &apos;ve heard about statistics of the hidden behind during the Cultural Revolution in the city , 6 : 00 demolished by the temple , 120 million people killed by Communist Party backbone molecules . 
this young man 喇嘛 班禅 皈依 father . 
China , he immediately after the invasion of people were killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together into Nepal . 
because mother , his family 富农 is locked up right here , and then when you sit down . 
and he was the only two his mother , his quietly hide in skirts and bring him into jail , because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister , because the offense 学习班 by and behavior . 
one day she there has to be not on the face of hairs about 臂章 and was convicted of Hygiene in 劳教 seven accept . 
to make the pain of Tibet human spirit bear to get the word &quot; salvation witness 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single is still in the world to a 五彩缤纷 , diversity of the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead in her once said before , the thing is the most worried , because we have to go into this kind of their native worldview , we only see the human imagination into a community of thinking 隘 陕 , and one day I woke up one day we will forget about the world , there are other possibilities . 
back in the world , we humans have been in the &apos; 60s , there &apos;s this drained . we feel guilty . 
human revolution 新石器 era , we enter the era of agriculture 腊 Beijerinck seeds 萨满 would be poetry of all the rabbi cheese . our modernity 社会分工 that the level of 10 : 00 years ago , the only thing . 
modern society is only going to close the 三百年 industrial history . 
in the history of this short , I think there &apos;s enough for millennia , we have to have to solve the challenges . 
when we asked different cultures of the world , the meaning of life , you will hear of different species of 10 : 00 . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to find as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully realize the species that we have to make sure that all the race to prosperity 昌盛 biology and all of life . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit people to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 called this talk to people about my grandfather was a story of his legacy . 
in Canada , in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always being built for the Inuit , because we sovereign we will -- the to them . 
this man who migrated to my grandfather . 
he worried about his family of the security of the tools , and he took all weapons . 
you all know the Inuit people , they always cold , this is the thick of God . 
the sled of them is the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of dry fish was freezing . 
this man , the grandfather of fear , not the blizzard 凛冽 and night . 
he slept on the outside , and he was wearing 长裤 skin seal , put his hands to shit faster shit until the stiffen blades , and he put it into shape . 
and in this to make a shit 口水 on the edge of the blades , and it becomes very rigid , frozen after having &apos;ve dealt with this , he &apos;s a dog . 
off the skin dog made out of the dog 挽具 chest , and he made a dog sleds condoms to other animals that don &apos;t was made shit to the original ice in the knife . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways that are on the Inuit , because all of the life of indigenous 顽强 becomes real . 
1999 four months of government to Canada than the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was home , and we called it the Lesters non-Inuit Le dimensions . 
this is a where they control their independence , all the territory of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and I think , for once , some of the world to the rural areas , actually , for people , not remote . 
because there is a species as home . 
they represent the branches of human imagination ancient dates back to the origin of the time for us all of these kids for people with our own dream the dreams of the children of the world is part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through television and National Geographic , which is what we do the things that politicians will not make grades . 
we think and argue is not to convince others , but we think about the fact that we can get to the world , so we could change the world is the fact about the site of our institutions , a click of thousands of three to five million 
we &apos;re in a 156 channels of the country . 
we have the readers of the magazine . 
we want to do is journey through a series of race , and we take the magic of the audience to see what they culture , everything &apos;s going to see that they can &apos;t help but feel powerful , and we hope to pollen more inclusive , and these experiences and reveals the core of human culture , this is the way to the survival of diversity , and we can actually live in a multicultural race to the world for all the wisdom of erotic to make all of human well-being . 
thank you . 
the blaise arcas Y aguera photosynth demo of this stunning , this software can change the way we watch . using digital images from the static pick out the photosynth created stunning photos , the dream of view , and can navigate . 
photosynth agueray blaise arcas . 
first , I want to use the fastest speed show you some new technology , the basic research , a year ago . it &apos;s a company that Microsoft acquired for us , and we did with Microsoft is this technology , it &apos;s a software seadragon . seadragon environment in it , you can 近景 or by the way from the vastness browse data visualization . 
we see here is -- many gigabytes and digital level of bytes 千兆 picture , and they can continue to the mapping of the , you can zoom in to browse through , and they can rearrange them . 
and see how the data , there &apos;s a lot of images , and how itself , images have seadragon to deal with this . 
this is all of the images taken by digital cameras , but this example of the picture , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress , images have 3亿个 pixels . 
however , what it doesn &apos;t look different , because the limits of performance system : just factors , what you like the use of the screen . 素数 seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is what Dickens &quot; The Stuff 山庄 desolate , the chapter is three . 
I give you that this is really text and the images , we can do this , you can see that it really is a rather text , images . 
maybe this is a way , the electronic books to read . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
the next is a more practical , this is an example , &quot; The Guardian . 
each one is a picture of opening did . 
and the newspaper or a magazine , which is itself the paper version of the proportion of the images , in reading , to get better , the readers experience , reading reading to enjoy the fun . 
we do here in the change in this little issues to &quot; The Guardian corner . 
we had a high resolution of fictional advertising than this image -- the ordinary ads , you see the normal high resolution of images , a lot of extra embedded in the content . 
if you want to see that the car , you can see here . 
you can see , technology , even version , the other dimensions . 
in this way , to some extent of the actual use a screen . 
we can reduce the technology that would be like the play out the window , and the information . 
obviously , the applications for this map , digital technology is also one of the obvious . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve got to make this field of our contribution . 
this is a picture of a NASA space in the geography . 
the process and get to the top of the road map . 
now , we look at these , put it down to the other . 
in fact , this technology already had online experience to yourself , you can imagine . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different : the technology . 
seadragon , and the other one is from the other is snavely noah graduate student at the University of Washington , what the research computer vision of this research . at University of Washington seitz Steve . 
and Microsoft szeliski Rick Institute . this is the help of a very beautiful . 
on the Internet in this project has a seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see , we &apos;re going to be the multiple ways to picture , looking for images that can communicate much more nuanced and have at the resolution to experience . 
but in these images of space , which is actually very meaningful . 
these pictures will algorithms visual computers connected together , so these images are going to be able to create a real space , and in this space that we took a picture of all of these pictures -- in Canada , is the Rockies grassi 西湖 and lakes , pull from nearby -- all the -- in this picture is taken down . so you can see here on the elements is full of stability , MRI or screening , and the content is all in space . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have more time to mapping the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of sense of more than this space . 
so let &apos;s look at the last summer , we use one of the early noah photosynth database of what the early prototype . I think it &apos;s definitely the technology we 抢眼 . of course , not technology , we like to show you in on a website that simple . 
mainly because when we make a website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions , the law . 
here &apos;s the use of reconstruct the image on the website , Flickr of Paris Notre Dame . you &apos;re going to do it on the website in Flickr ” Notre Dame Paris “ input , and then you can see the photograph of images , including the alleys , etc . , all these orange color represents the cone with a picture of to build models . 
these are all the images from Flickr , 串联 that by in space . 
and then , we can so easily to browse . 
DH : be honest , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
this is really quite amazing , welcome to . 
I think you can see that these images of many different from the camera : a single professional to the camera phones from an . so a lot of different by all of quality in this picture , put it in the environment . 
let me to find some more images of creepy . 
see , the picture of a touristy contains 大头 . , etc . , etc . 
I remember the should have a picture here -- ah , in here . 
this is the Notre Dame poster in Paris . 
we can get to see the poster to rebuild in the environment . 
here &apos;s the point that we can actually use effectively from the community . we can get everyone to different data to everyone in the environment , in the memory , collect together to build models . 
and all these pictures intertwined when the menacing , much more than just collecting up to all . 
this model is that , however , the whole planet . 
this is like the Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , and use as people would be complex , and it becomes more valuable . 
by the users , you know , went to the tag . 
if there are people willing to for all of these Notre Dame 圣贤 in that tag , they went on , who is a picture that we all have the Notre Dame , rich , and then we can start with this picture , into this space for this , what the picture by a lot of people who build a virtual world , to get across model , across the user interface experience . 
of course , this is another precious all of that is a very rich , this is the model -- in every corner of the landscape of interesting . these landscapes , not just in the air and satellite images , but actually 一刻所 pressing the shutter people of the collection of memories together . 
thank you very much . 
the right , if I understand this software , you will be able to a few years in the future of the images from the 接合 together ? 
the software . this is what &apos;s significant to explore . 
it builds up . in a link between . 
this is completely 接合 images based on the process of content . 
the more exciting , which is a picture of what the text semantic information . 
for example , you in the picture , what type in on the page , and that &apos;s going to be content with this picture of the relevant information . 
now , with all these pictures that image of you , that &apos;s going to do ? 
when the information , so these semantic within each of links , and that &apos;s going to the . this is a very typical network effect . 
blaise congratulate , so incredible ! you did . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist 施瓦茨 in a center for the Western society -- faith started freedom of choice 施瓦茨 in shock . the more it seems that we have more freedom to choose , let &apos;s get paralyzed . they have become much more pleasant , we have to bring more not satisfied . 
the Arabic 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I want to talk here in this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what &apos;s in here , I will try to help you put them together . 
I want to talk from a of faith . 
what kind of creed ? 
that &apos;s what the Western by not 笃信 industrial society , a credo . 
the principles is this : if we want to get people to the limit , the benefits that is to maximize to individual liberty . 
why is that this is freedom , which is nice in itself , has value , the need for people . 
other people , once we have the freedom , 做主 everyone can do with all kinds of benefits to limit for most people don &apos;t have , for me to 做主 . 
the freedom to that is a big enough to increase the selectivity . 
people more choice is freedom , freedom , more and more , it &apos;s also , the more the welfare . 
I think , this idea that we like , so that when you add it in the water into a deep-seated presumption that nobody would like to ask questions about it . 
and the same deep embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of social progress development contemporary look , we become possible to do things . 
this is my local supermarket . not a very big . 
I just want to say here salad ingredients . 
I was a supermarket , ingredients salad pronouncement 175种 is not the first would have specialized sign different 10 榨 olive oil and vinegar grapes balsamic 12 , if you let that happen to be 选购 175种 salad sauce , and not all of you , you could taste , the hook them with a big batch of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , this is the supermarkets . 
and then you turn out to be a one store to configuration that includes a three-dimensional stereo system -- a CD , blah , blah . an amplifier 磁带机 , radio , is that a 3D stereo system in the one that don &apos;t know how to count . 
in the store , you can create the components of 650万种 closer together with the three-dimensional stereo system . 
you couldn &apos;t admit it &apos;s not a pile of choice . 
in an industry , talk about communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and that &apos;s the only company , Bell Maya to this company . 
you don &apos;t need to buy a rented , just 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s going to die , not all bad . 
that 一去不返 already days . 
now I almost infinite variety of cell phone , especially -- it shows . 
these are the future of the mobile phone . 
one is the I in the middle of love -- with the same MP3 cut hair nose , play with the torch 布丁 forming a brownish caramel French . 
if you haven &apos;t in the store at your next if seen with no , don &apos;t worry , you &apos;ll see how the . 
this is the result of things to people , the store , you have to ask : don &apos;t have a function of with this ? 
you want , what &apos;s going to answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now you may not have to do not buy a mobile phone of so many things . 
also , in some other lives more than a shopping thing for us , this effect on the explosion of choice . 
health care -- in the United States are now , that &apos;s not a doctor , you go to the doctor , so how do you have to tell the time . 
instead , you will be a doctor , where doctors say to you : we can use nail treatment 乙 , can also use . 
and so forth , and make a nail . risk . 
and so forth , and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say : how “ Doctor , ” should I do ? 
doctors said these are very nail , again , risk , and make those 乙 with risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
doctor : you can ask , Doctor “ , I was going to you that you chose ” ? 
doctor , but I &apos;m not saying : “ ” is you . 
the result of that is what we say . municipalities patient “ ” sounds like a pretty good . it is to bear responsibility and to do from a people who do you know , I mean , they know 转嫁 to a cure for , and that is , don &apos;t require in the state of decided to do , that people who is the patient . 
now that , all of a prescription drugs for advertising with all the people that you and me . if you think about it . just say , if we can &apos;t buy counter to directly . 
why are they doing our campaigns to market ? 
the answer is , they want , we see the ads , to be in the morning after the doctor to call myself to the doctor , on a prescription , they put into the drugs . 
now , this identity , gender , like we do all of the topic of choice . it &apos;s like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but there to invented by myself . 
so we can shape itself back to the gender of identity . 
it also means that you wake up every morning you have to do to you today about the people in a kind of men and women are also the decision . 
in the marriage of families to everyone in the past , it &apos;s almost like age , and got married , of course , is that then 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need the choices , and who is what is not married , and when I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all the things you can get to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach the smart good is a group of students , but now I give them less than ever before , the assignment of one fifth . 
this is not because of the students than they used , stupid . it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now , why is that they are filled with brains , always in all sorts of things that I ask myself , what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and after the first is that ? I &apos;ll come back to the kids , and I knew business ? 
these are 脑筋 is the problem . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they are before I do not do homework , and the in my class and they take on what grades . 
they really should go to these problems , because this is something important question . 
now do work , like Carl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology in the day , we can make progress , any time , in a corner of the Earth -- any work and , of course , this hotel 夫 except in a basket . 
but , in this restaurant , you can actually have a place where the wireless Internet , but I &apos;m not going to tell you what . 
the reason is , don &apos;t tell you , I also want to use . 
we say in the back , the incredible work that we give freedom of choice is to bring in the choices we make decisions , again , again , again , for their work now , and it &apos;s about to break . 
we went to see the kids 裤兜 soccer , a mobile phone , and the other one with the 裤兜 blackberry and BlackBerry or lap , and the laptop computer . 
even though they were closed , we are burning in looking at the rivals for kids in constantly ask yourself this link or not , the phone ? 
back in the back or email ? I don &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give yourself , you know the answer is , not for the kids that the experience of the game is big compromised . it is . 
look around , whether it &apos;s still a big , long way of life is still a matter of choice , life is . 
and this is the life of the world . 
I mean , there &apos;s nothing there , but not to have a choice . 
and we live today is that the world . 
the question is , this is what &apos;s good or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know the benefits of it . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these two choices for people , and there are two negative impact . 
one , say , there &apos;s some inconsistent . choose , is that we are not for free , but the inside , is paralysis . 
people with the choice of that decision very difficult to find . 
let me give you a very vivid example to illustrate this point , this is a plan to wait pension about investing in terms of research . 
one of my colleagues at the vanguard access to record . in the vanguard is a big companies , have a foundation of employees and two , John 000多个 office . 
she found was , when these studies to their employees and customers . every species that helps fund to increase the 10 to reduce the number of two percent . 
you want to provide the 50种 fund , than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing to choose to fund 50种 to choose that it &apos;s even more difficult and tomorrow , so you can put . 
you tomorrow , tomorrow halide tomorrow , of course , that would never tomorrow . 
we know this actually means , when I retire , when people have just 充饥 dog food , because they don &apos;t have enough money to draw out in the future , and the thing to do , because it &apos;s so hard to employers , so that they have a pen , it &apos;s quite give the symmetrical for a grant . 
not to wait for this year , they make up from the 5千元 溜掉 employer symmetrical subsidies employer 手边 deeds . this is supposed to provide the support it . 
so , the more likely to have the choice is paralysis . 
it allows us to the world looks like this . this slide . 
when you go into a 极乐世界 , you have to make you hope is that it &apos;s not , right ? 
in there , you don &apos;t want to choose wrong helps fund , or is salad ingredients . 
and the first is that just . ) negative talk to them through a second . if I had to overcome paralysis and rigid , and finally made a decision to the right , we actually made of yourself as the sexual choice but to make the decision 少时 more happy . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
so , one of the salad ingredients species , if you buy a , think about , you really easy to imagine if you pick another results . okay ? this massive influx choices and imagine that you &apos;ve made for you to feel regret , for you to feel regret that you used to make the satisfaction of choice , even though it &apos;s actually a very good choice . 
the more choices to , for some strange thing to feel regret . this is one , is not always the choice to make yourself happy . 
secondly , economists call ” “ opportunity cost of things . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert , which is about a enough , we see a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people have a lot of choice , when you think it &apos;s easy to imagine that you to give up the choice of the people that you always . this is for you is that the chosen 美中不足 . 
so , for example , a cartoon that , if you don &apos;t have anything in New York , I was first 歉 a dish . 
but this is the right thing to be you . 
look at this two 口子 Hamptons . 
expensive , rich . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
more than that , you can also ? good in this to this guy , huh , bad really “ “ ” ” is now , in August . 
the Manhattan “ neighbors ” at home , not all . 
that &apos;s “ I want to go to the car stop in my own ” the door . 
for two weeks , and he was such an idea , torture 念叨 lost in every day to the best of the parking . 
to always ” “ opportunity cost for us to make is that even with enough to actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things that are , the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means a lot of problems . 
it &apos;s got to say this ” “ live in the present , including . maybe step to do things . 
but , of a truth is , when you choose to do , something that you do not to do it . 
these are the things that it attracted a lot of you will , and where do you &apos;re down to the fascinating things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
at this point , I had to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the past , jeans is that a pattern , you can &apos;t buy back , pants , shit , right , and very uncomfortable , until you put it in the long enough time to wash , after several times , to become 凑合 pants . 
this is that , in the years old , to the street , and finally , I had to buy a new . I said , I want to feed “ jeans , this is one of my ” sizes . 
and the : you want to say , of the comfort of sweatpants , or is it ? 
in front of his buttons . to the lockset is still 石磨 , or is it ? the wash ? 
to kind of breaking grinds faster ? 
it &apos;s also , the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 back to ask . 
my jaw , almost off . and I got over “ , I said to me , that &apos;s the only one was ” pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I took a 钟头 of all these damn jeans , finally , to be honest , I brought one of the most that I had never 合身 stores out the door . 
I don &apos;t really make that choice . these are wrong , I have to do better . 
but you feel it worse . 
why ? specifically for that I have to write a book for my own excusing . 
and I felt worse , is the reason is because of that , I can choose the right to have a jeans , what &apos;s more good expectations of how much warmer . 
I was very low expectations . and when a jeans is so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , there is one of the economy at the perfect . 
the one that I really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I get , and I hope I have to compare the than I expected , and I , and it becomes disappointing . 
in the lives of people , except choice together to improve people &apos;s more good things what to expect to the outside , and how many people with no benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
there &apos;s nobody to know the market , the truth . because if they understand people &apos;s inside , you wouldn &apos;t have to know what is this cartoon means . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this , in cartoons and in all the bad things all over the past . better than now . 
when one of the reasons is that when people do not have good experience to some surprises . 
now , that we in the industrialized , wealthy of civic life , in the world &apos;s ambitious for , for every one of the things you don &apos;t want it to more than you expect . 
what you &apos;ll never be surprised , because you know , my God , or higher than expectations . 
what is the secret of happiness , this is going to come here today , you know , which is : the secret of happiness 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
and I give you a little bit of time to talk about ourselves , and now I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
the thing that I had to 凑合 , I don &apos;t . 
but it &apos;s not necessarily 凑合 can be bad . 
and finally , buy a result of jeans 合身 not one of the store , which is , when there &apos;s only when you can buy a car , you feel happy , not to know why , who is responsible for this ? the answer to the world , obviously . this is responsible for this . you have to do ? what ? 
now in a shop for jeans hundreds of choice you buy a , you don &apos;t think back to ask you happy , and the responsibility for what , who ? 
now this is obviously the answer the question is : you . 
you can do better . 
on out there , and no excuse jeans hundreds of the things that you do it . 
it is , when people make decisions to decide that even when it is they &apos;re very good . disappointed , to decide to blame myself . 
in this generation of our past , in the industrialized world -- countries and explosive growth is clinically depressed . 
I believe that the explosive growth of a suicide and depressing , important , but it &apos;s not the only factor is important , all of those people is the experience of disappointing . why is too high standard of their . when they have to explain how these things to experience what it is , they think of their own , this is wrong . 
and finally , the net effect on objective , though , is that we had to do better than ever before , but they don &apos;t like from the feeling before . 
I remind you . 
this choice recognized that the principles of happiness , we all think , is actually , is the wrong . not entirely . 
there &apos;s no better than no choice , but don &apos;t choose to this picture is that the more choices . 
here &apos;s a key value is , I don &apos;t know how many . 
but I knew we certainly can ‘ far beyond what we choose the richest , the key to ’ value . 
I said . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , give us the industrialized society , how do the choice of the matter is so rich . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world that we , at least , we heard there in a few of them is not the problem , too many choices . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies of the wealth of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday , said that the indignant , the problem is that we make it hard and expensive car seats , the baby 于事无补 , just in waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that the complicated , expensive 于事无补 , is not only choice . 
they bring us to actually hurt . 
they don &apos;t have to actually , as we get from ago . 
if we put this society to create these out of the human system that now to commit to choose not enough people to the society , so you can only get there , improving the lives of people , we have the same quality of life . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve the way . 
that would redistribution products , all of the poor , is not a good life , because we got rid of those of us , like extra plague of choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon up in a wise man , and , of this fish “ understood , huh ? 
tell you , in this fish in the impossible is everything ” . 
no imagination , have -- I first saw this painting interpretation of it is . 
but the more clearly , I want to be happy to know what this fish . 
because , if you want to be honest , everything becomes possible , and the fish , you get to the paralyzed , it &apos;s not freedom to fish and die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
that &apos;s the increased you reduce the is , paralyzed . 
everyone needs a fish “ ” . 
and this is a fish . and for this fish , it is possible for us , a little almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s a symbolic of suffering that means that fish , maybe , is going to disaster . 
thank you very much . 
“ from the digital world , we can create new life ? ” Craig Venter . he said , &quot; is answering your ” and “ can . he will soon , and he introduced the promise of research and recently , we make , and soon will have the ability to activate a chromosome . 
Craig Venter , which will make artificial life . 
in this project , I &apos;ve been talking about that part of the human genome , and they found a new meaning . and the genome . 
this is a new from our perspective , we work in the digital in biology . and now we &apos;re trying to code , the numbers from a design , new of biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I want to keep many biologists are in a different level to understand the problem . 
we tried many ways , put it down to the tiny components . 
now we have almost 20 years with a digital . when we put it in the human genome sequence from it , the analysis of biology , computer simulations of September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask if life , we went from this , or whether we can create new digital world in the life ? 
this is a map sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . for one , it &apos;s the smallest genome species can make it replicate themselves in the lab , we &apos;re trying to understand . and if we can find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from 一百组 500组 genes that we are in the eyes of these . 
but when we look at the metabolism of it , this is actually relatively simple for the relative to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple . but when we look at all of these , we can separate , one of the genome , very hard to believe that it can create a living cell . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these synthetic chromosome is so part of it , we can change the fundamental to continue to ask the question . 
so we started to walk along this path “ we can ” synthetic chromosome ? 
we really principle of chemicals that we never allowed to make the overlarge molecules ? 
and , if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is just the live without some chemistry . 
we constantly digital life in the exponential rate faster . 
the genetic code to write our very slow to progress , but also the increase in the last . we &apos;re going to speed up to exponential curve . 
we started this work in 15 years ago . 
in fact it for the first stage . in the experiment we did the first years ago , a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it &apos;s synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
十几万台 device in the world to make a little pieces of DNA , 30 to 50 in length , and this is a symbol back to the manufacturing process , the more than that , the more the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions in the wrong , and it all together . 
this is our first try , and from Phi X 174 genome to the phage digital information . 
it &apos;s a small viruses can kill bacteria . 
we designed it through the gene , has made a mistake , it &apos;s the DNA of a 5,000 character . 
stage of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t have to live , put into the chemicals , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the bacteria made the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill a different and E. coli 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently communicate with the oil industry , and I think there &apos;s some for them to understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud of more than you . 
so what we think this is actually a biological system in software can make yourself in the hardware . 
but we still want to expand . we hope to make the entire bacterial chromosomes 580 , 10,000 , a symbol than the length of the genetic code in . and we think we should be in the size of the virus ” “ box that they make these changes , we can understand ” “ box , a part of the living , what is the actual cells ? 
design is very important in the computer , and if you start using digital information to information . that is very accurate , these numbers . 
when we first in 1995 , gene sequencing to this group of subjects , 10,000 every single standard for a fundamental mistake . 
again , we found , in fact , the average sequence is 30 mistakes . if we use the sequence , this is probably never set of genes . 
design is the work of some of the 50 design and symbol than the rest of the character 50 to build smaller pieces of units . we have to design , so they can come together . 
we have one of the unique . 
you may have heard of in our 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character , A , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way , these scripts like about 20 amino acids , there are amino acids , every tag a character . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the first is , what we do with it to the sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , we don &apos;t do it with a poem . 
and we can use these fragments bias to enzymes are enzymes . some cut to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started making pieces , from the fragments of character 70 , put them together to make the symbol of 24 , more than 10,000 out into the 72 merger than 10,000 , of a long time . 
at every stage , we had these fragments of culture , so we can sequence them , because we want to create a process of very reliable , you will see in a minute . 
we try to get automated level . 
it looks like the 篮球赛 对阵 is a graph . 
when these very big piece for basic over 100 , 10,000 when they &apos;re very hard to keep the coil . in the long to grow more as . in the modern tools of molecular . after all , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred to reprogram biology , with the DNA repair than can put it back together . 
here &apos;s an example of a tolerance called microbes 三百万度 球菌 the radiation dose radiation to bear . 
you can see the views on top of it , in different places in nieces chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , it myself before going back together again , the original . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these are able to completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that life is outer space , and move around , the water with a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown that a lot of examples . 
here we have this photograph of the molecule . these microscopic images , it &apos;s yeast mentioned in front of the way through , and we put into the design of the automatically yeast . they talk . 
this is not just an electron microscope picture ; it is the normal optics microscope . 
this is the size of a molecule that we can look at it with a optics microscope . 
these are the 六秒 for about a long time . 
this is what we came out of the trials recently . 
this is a symbol than the genetic code 580000 . it &apos;s made by the human set structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t 10-point font , depending on the will to print out . total 142页 to print the genetic code 
how do we get a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus that bacteria do a very simple more complicated . 
we like to deal with nuclear creatures like this , and the really , you can take a relatively simple into another , and then the cells , this is the , you hear about it . 
for the bacteria , they 连成 the chromosome one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant cells chromosome from one to another to activate the cells . 
the microbes from a population that we extract chromosomes . basically , this is the difference between two and a mouse . as humans , we add some new genes that we can choose these chromosomes with enzymes . we all get them down to the protein , when we put it into the situation , cells , very amazing happens to you what we would like to make very sophisticated -- the images . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this process is to go . but we have this some more the design process . 
this is a major evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second , or the chromosome from other species , the third place in the chromosomes , within seconds the thousands and thousands of new features to its own . 
what people used by the time in the process of evolution , there will be just the idea of a genetic change a lot of biological ignoring the realities . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limit enzymes to digest the DNA . 
the chromosome out of cells don &apos;t think that this enzyme , and when we have this enzyme built into a chromosome . 
it &apos;s performance , and figure out a chromosome out of the matter is external to it , it is that we finally , there &apos;s a new cells of DNA . 
we put into the gene that causes it became blue . 
in very short period of time , all the characteristics of the species that were all disappeared , and completely into a new species , the cells , we put on a new software “ ” . 
all of the protein , and all the membrane , change -- when we change it reading the genetic code , the fact that we will implant it . 
this might sound like the genetic alchemists turning discord , but we can actually move through DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I want to say this is not -- this is the last century , in the evolution of 3.5 billion years . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do this ? 
I think that we need to do some of the reasons is very clear . 
we will be in the population in 40 years from the next nine billion into 65亿 
for example , in my own , I was born in 1946 
now , the three people on the relative to us from 1946 , every one of the people that exist in the next 40 years ; , within four . 
65亿 people in our food for the water , clean , medicine , very difficult to all the fuel . 
that &apos;s a switch 捉襟见肘 nine billion people . 
we use 300多亿桶 50亿顿 over oil , coal . it &apos;s the day . 10 . 
when we try to think that this creature . it can replace or whatever , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that all of this material in the atmosphere of the CO2 emissions . 
we now have found from around the world in a database of genes 两千万组 about , and I &apos;m in the future , as they put the design components . 
there &apos;s only industry electrical to 10 parts , and look at the diversity that can get . 
now we from the constraints of the reality of biology , and our imagination . 
we now have the technology , because that &apos;s what we can make these “ ” mix of the group to synthesize the very quickly . 
we now have the ability to make a larger robot made a day , we can make a chromosome . 
when you think of this processed 两千万组 different genes , and try to optimize the steps 制剂 辛烷 or make drugs that , and the new vaccine , we can change , even a small team , it can do better than what the history of science , the last 20 years of doing molecular biology , the more work . 
and this is just a standard choice . we can choose to live , to produce biofuels , or chemical production vaccine , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is some work that we actually sit with real computer in the design of the species to software design . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks them . we know exactly what is the genetic code . 
we focus on the “ ” 第四代 fuel . 
you will see recently into corn ethanol . it &apos;s a bad trial . 
soon we will have a second and third is sugar . fuel into higher value , for example , the fuel 丁醇 辛烷 or different types of . 
but we think the biology of can make a huge impact on the food , and not limited to increase the cost of sex with the way , but if we can start is with the material , carbon dioxide , as it . so we &apos;re designing a new cells can live in this path development . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get the first 第四代 fuel . 
is CO2 and sunlight -- one . 
so it -- but we found from around the world in the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a kind of microbes that are in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane into the molecule energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to collect their , they &apos;re very convenient , then it can be introduced into , with the fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase what for ? &quot; &quot; life is to understand the fundamental problem . 
we did with the whole oil industry has a little good . but if you can &apos;t do that in TED , where there might be a major ? the energy . 
and we also use the same instant out of the tools to make a vaccine . 
you see all of this year to slow flu , we always time of year , the lack of money , and in the case that when the vaccine . 
I think this is a vaccine was made by can change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species have such an artifact for the bacteria , nuclear is really the biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a farther away from the human to improve the lives of the goal is . we have the opportunity to make sure that we live long enough to the time , maybe that &apos;s the thing to do that . thank you very much . 
the estimated 09年 TED in this short talk , Brian Cox super Collider share some of which , including the news . the nest maintenance workers are now with this in the history of the landscape of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : the LHC out what happened ? 
in the last year I speak at TED , the LHC . 
and I said , you must have come back to the machine is running update it . 
this is it , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is coming on the scale of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
in the universe reinventing the billionth of a second every state , and began to make a second state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is the mechanical underground in Geneva 
we use these detectors for little photographing the Big Bang . 
this is my work on , ATLAS . the inaugural detector 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas , you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas 
the control room was rejoiced with trembling . 
this is the small number of particles , as we all around the LHC along with a plan of , part of the LHC in particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see that in September 10-point . we know this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know , this is a -- this is also 满堂喝彩 on Google , when people see , this is an icon front page . 
this suggests that we work with the culture of science . it &apos;s significant , the same . 
but about a week later , we went out of the machine to the point about -- these are the Golden 导线 导线 
and when they conduction 导线 all 安培 current . 
now , some of you might say , engineers , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do , because when they are very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so in the space between the planet than 271摄氏度 below the temperature of these cases , the stronger 导线 can conduction electricity . 
in the LHC 九千多个 in one of the 电磁铁 接点 technology to install a mistake . 
so a little bit 导线 temperature rise to the transmission it by resistance 安培 current suddenly more 
this is . 
very shocking , because the material they move up the magnet , about a mile constructed . 
we have about 50 magnets impaired . 
and unloaded , put them to work done . 
we give them , it out . 
now , back waiting for them . 
by the LHC in about three of refer again . 
we will be launched in six , and it was July to get the data , and then continue our mission to find out the basic units of the universe . 
obviously , again , now . so one of these accidents frontier of science and engineering , but these very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s still too difficult task , but the fact that we try and projects , which is itself in the value of the LHC . 
and I want to 戴维翰 复述 warren , a British scientists , and I remember him as an apprentice myself in the meaningless to defend the experiment is an apprentice -- he 法拉 Michael for said -- the human brain development for more than anything , dangerous , this idea that we have to understand : the science as a human unravel all mystery that has been 全胜 and stop for a new benefit of exploration . 
thank you . 
the great for the incredible contemporary art , thanks to social often the creator itself , and people &apos;s genius exposed to the art of unusual . Elizabeth Gilbert , a little bit about this , to explore and thinking about the idea of creating genius , with a 独到 that &apos;s a genius “ ” , as in art , and he said to her “ ” genius of the help of a . this is a personal talk , interesting vivid 令人感动 and full color , inspired . 
呵护 . Elizabeth Gilbert about stress make them and creativity . 
I was a writer , writing the career , I was not more , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I was a writer , writing the career , I was not more , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I was a writer , writing the career , I was not more , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , I work in the life of a special events that happened , despite the recent work in my life , in a special happened again , I had to make the event , and I think about the relationship between my work . 
this particular event is : I published the latest 回忆录 the beauty of that book , &quot; love , and pray that particular event is : I published the latest 回忆录 the beauty of that book , &quot; I love , and I pray , who used to work very generic as big as , somehow book was an incredibly tragic event , international exciting , somehow bestseller into a book was an incredibly tragic event , diplomas , international exciting . 
and now , it turns out to me , I think all people , where life is , this is what this to me anyway , now , where life that I think people like that . 
and this is really , really play , saved 完了 ! 
they will very quickly , I came to worry about “ you not afraid to say : ? . you don &apos;t have this book beyond all that ” book ? 
would you “ you not afraid to write this life forever , that are not write a piece of love “ ” ? what would you like , you not afraid of life , and writing and writing , don &apos;t always love that ” “ ? work . you don &apos;t you write that will forever , life , and that &apos;s not write a piece of love “ ” ? what would you like , you not afraid of life , and writing and writing , don &apos;t always love that ” work ? 
they really are going to comfort people . 
I would have a hard day , fortunately , I remembered writers , 20 years ago , I decided to become a day of the things that would be very difficult , fortunately , to 20 years ago , I remembered that the writer , I was a teenager , I was around the same question , I met people said , you will never be afraid not success ? 
I was around the same question , I met people said , you will never be afraid not success ? 
you not afraid to take you to the bearing down upon ? 
you don &apos;t have to be afraid to life without a what ? you not afraid of what life is a work ? you have a broken , and the dream of going to die in filled with despair , you will fail in the pain of the dreams of broken with die , despair , in the center of failure . 
you end up in the dreams of fragmented , dead despair and in the center of failure , and I &apos;ve got to question . 
the question , and the answer is : the simple ” “ . 
yes , that &apos;s all kinds of people like today . 
yes , that &apos;s all kinds of people like today . 
actually , except that , I was scared of something else , actually , to not guess , except that , I was afraid to not many people think . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , to say , I was writing , I &apos;ve been wondering recently , why ? writing afraid to say , but I was writing , until recently , I kept thinking of writing ? why ? 
this is the idea is a rational ? 
people are afraid of doing their job ? this destined ? logical destined people afraid of doing their job ? logical this ? 
how creative work , and there &apos;s so much of our special-ness , the mental health for each other about work ? it &apos;s a really creative special-ness , that &apos;s how we worry about the mental health for each other ? it &apos;s not sustainable other industries , this is not to ? 
for example , my dad was a chemical engineer in his career in chemical engineering 40 years , I don &apos;t remember someone asked him if he was a chemical engineer in chemical engineering 40 years of career , remember , I don &apos;t have to be afraid if he asked engineers , chemistry . 
nobody said : work “ meet John , chemistry ? bottleneck ” ? 
never have to ask this happened . 
of course , that engineers , chemical 平心而论 groups , not in the last few centuries , and depression , alcoholism 享誉 狂躁 addiction , not in the past few centuries , and depression , alcoholism 享誉 狂躁 addiction , around the world . 
and not in the last few centuries , and depression , alcoholism addiction , global 享誉 狂躁 writers , down , and we have indeed writers , not only that , in the field of reputation creative people seem to have the emotions and not very stable , writer 恶名 of the field with creative people seem to have 恶名 very stable . 
just look at the century , a early creative great 英年早逝 geniuses in the case of a century , just to see in early creative genius , they all the great examples , age is often 英年早逝 gently died . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show that they have a talent , even if the suicide , and often , they show absolutely no talented . 
and before he died 曼梅 , in the last time , I said , in every book “ 蚕食 all ” part of me . 
for you , this is the work of life , how radical statement . 
but for those of us , because we already are 见怪不怪 视若无睹 , but we are to these claims 见怪不怪 视若无睹 , because we already know why , and all the people in completely already have this idea . ideas that pain and creativity is : create art , and that &apos;s going to be 苦闷 creativity and ideas . it is : create art , that will eventually 苦闷 extreme 
today I want to ask the room for all of you , is that ? I had no exceptions here today to ask you , you have no dispute about that ? 
you think this is a problem ? not even further away at this point , I don &apos;t agree with this kind of a click away from the outside in , even at this point , I don &apos;t agree that outside in 
this terrible 可憎 , and not only that , I don &apos;t want to continue all the idea of this next century . 
this view , not terrible 可憎 , and the idea that I don &apos;t want to continue this next century has this terrible 可憎 , and not only that , I don &apos;t want to continue all the idea of this next century . 
I think the great we encouraged creative genius , more kids will live . 
and I , myself , and the owner in my view is due to the dark , my own , and the owner in my view is due to the dark , especially in my career , especially now in the stages of my career . 
you see , I was a young age , I get to 40 , you see , I was a young age , I get 40 . 
there &apos;s also about 40 years , I give my . 
and that &apos;s probably , from that moment , every movie I &apos;ve written by going to work with was an incredibly tragic event , and I did on a big , and compare the ? not to be all the book , and I was an incredibly tragic event , and compare the big is not to do ? 
well , frankly , we are in a talk at that time , I said , quote , &quot; and the friends there might very well , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , this is what the idea . 
so , this idea is that people like 大清早 on a journey -- a way to not wine that God who is this idea , let &apos;s 大清早 on a journey -- a way to the pub . I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question becomes : I should do ? 
and in a deeper view , I think , to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , I had to create some psychological protection . 
in some way , I have to build a safe distance from writing itself , and I work for the responses from anxiety extreme itself , writing for my response , and the extreme anxiety . 
a year ago , I can look around , the reference for patterns , also in the history of the different cultures in a year ago , I look around , you can find in the reference for patterns , also in the history of the different cultures around for a year ago , I can look at the reference for patterns , in the history of the different cultures , they find a better than we have more rational , to help with the idea that art 艺术工作者 inherent within the risk of emotion in art , to help what 艺术工作者 processing of emotional risk inherent in . 
it took me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please , I hear the patient to go back to us , because the problem . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , to the sacred creativity is a distant and unknowable 精灵 from place to the next artist , with a remote and unknowable and distant from the purpose of the unknowable , artists to place with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks common to call this kind of creative accompanied “ stewards for 精灵 ” for 
and people often think that &apos;s Socrates , from a stewards for a general wisdom was that people give him to think that &apos;s Socrates from afar , he gives stewards for wisdom . 
the people in ancient Rome , they have similar to this idea of creating intangible ” “ genius 精灵 called ancient Rome , who have similar to this idea of creating intangible , they called 精灵 ” “ genius 
this is a wonderful , because people don &apos;t think of Roman ” “ genius of personal is a very , very intelligent , wonderful , because this isn &apos;t that Roman “ genius who is a particularly intelligent ” personal . 
they think is a wonderful “ genius of the sacred ” in that even ” “ genius , they live in an artist &apos;s studio in the walls of 精灵 , just like a little more than that even ” “ genius , they live in an artist &apos;s studio , like , wall of a little more than they would 精灵 drilling quietly for artists , invisible to work on , and they will quietly 成败 intangible , drilling , and to help artist 成败 work . 
this is just the idea is that , of looking at me , this is the safe distance from work to protect the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand it is not the business model , right ? 
by the artist ancient protected , and get this idea of the , by the artist ancient narcissistic , and this idea to protect , get narcissistic too . 
if you work great , in fact , that &apos;s because you can completely , you know you &apos;re in a glass of ” “ genius of work done . 
if you work , also , very bad is not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you ” “ genius , very bad . 
this is the Westerners in the past , looking for a long time of creativity . 
and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea , and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea : to let us “ in the universe in a human heart , beyond the gods “ ” mysterious and unknown to us in the human heart , in the universe beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown ” for space , so it &apos;s not the gremlin who will sacred . 
this is the beginning of humanism reason to believe , people from all the individual human creativity , this is the beginning of humanism reason to believe , people from all the individual human creativity , this is the beginning of humanism reason to believe , people from all the individual human creativity . 
the first time ever , people will be a genius “ called , artists , and not have a ” “ ” genius , the first time ever , people will be a genius “ called , artists , and not have a ” “ ” genius , the first time ever , people will be a genius “ called , artists , and not have a ” “ ” genius 
and I want to say is , I think that &apos;s a big mistake . 
so a person , even a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred , create , of these things and unknown with access to believe that jihad , and he &apos;s a sacred , and they create , of these things and unknown with access to believe that he was a jihad , and they create sacred , these things and unknown , the source of a jihad , and he asked for fishes , the sun swallow one-nth of vulnerability for this , is too big . 
he asked for fishes , the sun swallow one-nth of vulnerability for this , is too big . 
this is a distorted completely cognitive self , and the people for people to the expansion of the great achievement , this line of a distorted completely cognitive themselves to the individual , and it was done for this . 
I think , is this pressure , in the last 500 years , I think artists countless get this pressure , which is in the last 500 years of artists staving . 
and I think , at least that &apos;s really , this is the problem is that we have now is : how do we do ? we can change this ? 
so we now the question is : how do we do ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the old , the more they reference to the for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the old , the more they reference to the for human creativity and understanding ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , the 18 minutes , the development of the question-asking 500多年 . the reason that we can &apos;t talk with a short 18 out of the question-asking 500多年 , the rational human development . 
and maybe in the audience today , they are grounded in evidence suggested to someone &apos;s questioning , and maybe the science of the audience today , that people can ask this question of science , they are grounded in evidence 精灵 fairy 批驳 to work with artists , the owner of the water there on the idea is ridiculous 精灵 批驳 this fairy tales , with the artist who works there on the idea is ridiculous of water . 
maybe I can convince you of I agree with you . 
but I want to say is : why not ? why not ? thinking differently , but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is : why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
that &apos;s all kinds of people to explain the creative process of uncertainty , that in theory , I heard 精灵 theory and all the other theory , or as fair to say that this irrational 精灵 theory , and I heard a reasonable all other theories as irrational as or so . 
this process , to have a for any of you who believe that there was all sitting in this experience of the creative process and not to know the reason always . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s beyond common 
recently I say , for example , the great American poet visibly see . a silk 九十多岁 斯通 bowhead silk have been a poet , and I said to her when she lives in Virginia when things in the home to her , and then suddenly , almost manic 田间 hear and feel poem , from afar , and her running in her , and then suddenly , almost manic 田间 hear and feel poem , from afar , and her running in her , and then suddenly , almost manic 田间 hear and feel poem , and her running away from . 
like , on a breath of emptying down at her . 
she can feel it comes to power , because this is the 撼动 her feet . 
she can feel it comes to power , because this is the 撼动 her feet . 
when the time , she can do with the only thing she said , is to really “ ” dashed across 
the home to her , and that dashed across a poem with chasing would go home to her , and that dashed across the poem with chasing the will to her , pen and paper , explained to find in the power to capture , when she lived through a poem that on paper , put it to remember to find the paper , she explained , in this pen , and the power to capture , when she lived through a poem that on paper , put it to remember to find the paper , she explained , in this pen , and the power to capture , when she lived through a poem that remember , put it in the paper . 
and she was there , she wasn &apos;t fast enough to run , and it &apos;s a poem that home , and Pentium already , so she would miss a poem that she had to run , and it &apos;s a poem that home , and Pentium already , so she &apos;s a poem that was wrong , and she said that in a poem will continue to move between fields “ down for a poet , she said that poem ” will continue to move between fields , in the “ ” for a poet . 
in some other time , this is the most part , called me in the memorable , some other called me , this is part of the most , and she said she almost to have some 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running home pen and paper , looking for a poem that , and she went to go through about it , she grabbed right in the pen , and she went to a poem that , and it was in her right through to her and grab the other hand , grab out a poem that to her tail , and the other hand , grab out a poem that tail . 
and she would take the other hand , grab the tail of a poem that get it back on the other hand , poetry to put it in 誊写 on paper , get back to the other hand , in 誊写 poetry on paper . 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is in reverse order , just from the beginning , the last word go by , until after the first , before . 
except , from the sequence is upside down to the last word go by , until after the first words , I heard her story : it &apos;s incredible , like this , the creative process , and I did it ! I hear the story of her : it &apos;s incredible , like this , the creative process , and I . 
I heard her story : it &apos;s incredible , like this , the creative process , and I , of course , it &apos;s not me ! -- all of the creative process , I don &apos;t work , I was more like a so . 
and of course , the creative process , and it &apos;s not all , I don &apos;t work , I was more like a way to the same time , so I get up every day , the MetroCard , and I have devoted to work every day , and the same time , to get to devoted bad . 
but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get an accident , but even the inspiration 古板 occasionally , I would like to get an accident . 
and maybe sitting in a kind of experience . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , it would have to know where inspiration , and if you think , people like me would also 墨守成规 , and where I met the inspiration . 
how is this happening ? 
we want to see it in the way , do not rational ? we have lost in the way to see how that loss , it will not rational ? 
I know , the contemporary artists in to deal with this problem is the best 汤姆威兹 musician , I know that in the contemporary artist with a problem , this is the best musicians to 汤姆威兹 a few years ago , I was a magazine , he interviewed work when we talk about this problem . 
a few years ago , I was a magazine , he interviewed work when we talk about this problem by creating stress is Tom or the torture is Tom typical of modern artists creative or the stress of modern artists all the time , and he spend a typical in not trying to control , management of control over that can &apos;t spend time in the creative inspiration , he was trying to control , management and the control over that can &apos;t spend time in the creative inspiration , he was trying to control , management and the control over that time , but not in creative inspiration . 
but as he gets older , or to 敛 沉静 within a day , I told him , he said , and in Los Angeles on Highway drive change one thing that happened in my life , he said , he told me that one day he drove highways in Los Angeles , and the thing that happened that changed his life . 
he was going up , suddenly , he had a little bit about half the beautiful ♪ ♪ melodies , he was going up , suddenly , he had a little bit about half the beautiful intractable ♪ melodies and rhythms that ♪ into his mind , like the temporary inspiration violin , unpredictable and tempting to intractable melody that into his mind , like the temporary inspiration , unpredictable and that was his violin tempting to want to capture it , but no , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder , and the pen and paper 
he was going to capture it , but there &apos;s no way , his pen and paper was he a tape recorder , don &apos;t want to capture it , but no , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder , and the pen and paper 
the familiar , that he feels he created anxiety “ get inside , and I &apos;m going to lose the inspiration , and this piece will not 阴魂 永世 ” tortured me to go , I just want to lose this “ inspiration , and this piece will 阴魂 永世 ” I don &apos;t go to torture 
no , I “ I couldn &apos;t do ”

he looked at for it to the sky , “ sorry , you said , I can &apos;t see ” driving ? he looked at for it to the sky , “ sorry , you said , I can &apos;t see ” in drive ? 
he looked at for it to the sky , “ sorry , you said , I can &apos;t see ” driving ? is it looks like I remember instantly to the next piece looks like ? 
if you really want to pick another , in the world in the right time , and when I was in the fields in the world , if you really want to pick another , the right time , and when I was convenience .

today , or you can go out to others , harassing 科恩 to 莱昂纳德 de 
since that thing , after the creative process of Tom . 
it &apos;s not the work , he still is completely dark . 
but when he put creative genius to pull itself from when the creative process , accompanied by a severe anxiety and the challenge creative genius , but when he to pull itself from when the creative process , accompanied by a huge challenge to anxiety and creative inspiration is just , is to bring in pain , it was liberated 原处 倒像 , and he put it back , and he realized that will have thought of itself in inspiration , torture . 
creative inspiration , and this is the unknown , he &apos;s in between the strange and weird and wonderful relationship with creative inspiration , and this is the unknown , he &apos;s in between the strange and weird and wonderful relationship with the outside , that there is a itself . 
this story pernicious work I change the way , this transformation has saved me this story pernicious work I change the way , this transformation has saved me again . 
that is , in the beauty of love , pray , when I was a anxiety , of despair , The 无底洞 that is in love , pray , food , &quot; I was a kind of despair anxious to 无底洞 inspiration , but not 低潮 state of despair that this work , and then you will be a completely worst ever be failure of the book . 
it &apos;s not completely , and that &apos;s the worst shit , I started to think I should give up wrote this book . 
it &apos;s not completely , and that &apos;s the worst shit , I started to think I should give up wrote this book . 
and I remembered Tom , shouting and for the day , and then I tried to try to Tom reminds me of the day , shouting and the thing , and then I tried to .

and then you “ out loud , said that this guy , and I listen to “ ” 咱 both know , if this book , it &apos;s not a person is not my fault , isn &apos;t it ? you know , both 咱 “ ” , if this book is not that , not my fault , not one ” is ? 
“ because you can see , I &apos;ve not committed to maintain order of a ” “ because you can see , I &apos;ve not committed to maintain order of ” . 
if you “ to this book is better , you turn to now , some of them work , do you ” of that . 
if you “ to help , that &apos;s not that you see ” right to go to hell . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
I hope that the historical record today , I said I hold the 尽责 jobs , perhaps today , I hope that the historical record , and I said , I hold 尽责 jobs . 
I hope that the historical record today , I said I hold the 尽责 jobs , because that &apos;s because in the last few centuries ago , people in the North Africa in the next to the sacred 月色 in parties , we had a century ago , people in the North Africa in the next to the sacred 月色 gathering where we until the last several hours . 
the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer and the professional performing a wonderful , because they are the professional dancer . 
occasionally , very few of the time , and indeed , but something will happen to be a dancer 出世 transcendent , and beyond 
you should know , I say this , because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , the performance . 
time to stop the dancer , the time as a dancer , stop it seems like he did across the before and what doesn &apos;t show 1000场 , but different miraculous , but everything , uniformity . 
&quot; , he &apos;s not a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , from the bottom . 
&quot; , he &apos;s not a normal human , the light from the inside of his life , from the bottom of the light and shine by sacred fire . 
clearly , people were , you know , they can , this is what it was called the name of this , people know this is what it is , they can name . 
they would take to raise your hand , Alabama , to do , Larry , Larry , Larry , God . ah , God , they would take to do to raise your hand , Alabama , Alabama , Larry , Larry , Larry , God , God . 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles phenotype . 
the interesting thing is , when Moore &apos;s Law 野史 invasion of southern Spain empires , they brought this tradition the interesting thing is , when Moore &apos;s Law 野史 invasion of southern Spain empires , they brought this tradition , a few centuries , and the sounds 颂词 “ changes gradually , Alabama , from Alabama into ” 嘞 “ ” 嘞 , you know , so you know , a few centuries , and the 颂词 “ from Alabama , Alabama into ” 嘞 “ ” 嘞 , you know , you know , you can still 斗牛 today in the game and 戈 弗拉明 喝彩声 hear it . 
in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , when the magic of that you all are cheering you on your way : would you “ 嘞 , Alabama 嘞 , Alabama , you know , really , really great , great , that &apos;s miracles ” phenotype . 
this is very good , because this is what we need . 
the tricky for artists , the dancer and the next morning , is 悠悠 to wake up , and artists around the most tricky is 悠悠 dancer , the next morning , that is already turned wake up , 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and that &apos;s just will bad leg , when the old , and he might mortals couldn &apos;t get the height of that last night . 
maybe he will not dance to people in the realm of miracles all are cheering you on your way since about how to him ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is also the pain of one of the cognitive self . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is also the pain of one of the cognitive self , this is a very tricky issues , which is also the pain of one of the cognitive self . 
but maybe , we have been so painful , if you were never thought , that is starting from the work of art , if you didn &apos;t you think , that &apos;s the hell you from completely art . 
if you think there are some amazing , is just the loan , you just give you a piece of 精美绝伦 is , if you think they just , sort of magic is temporarily , you can bring you to work in the 精美绝伦 after you get to work on other people . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
in the past few months , I started looking at it this way of a problem in the past few months , I started looking at it this way , and the problem in the book I wrote a book that describes , dangerous , by the people of the line , and after I 大作 selling the work that was dangerous , by hyper-consumption , describes the expected of me , and after the 大作 selling . 
and I need to do , is to tell ourselves , especially when I was in the impatience depression , and I need to do , is to tell ourselves , especially in my depression “ : agitated , don &apos;t fear , third way raga that you need to do good ” of work . 
third way raga “ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t need to do good , just that you ” of work . 
third way raga “ don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t need to do good , just that you ” of work . 
you hold the jobs of the jobs , whether you : if you is what is a dancer , that &apos;s dancing . 
you hold the jobs of the jobs , whether you : if you is what is a dancer , that &apos;s dancing . 
if you belong to the of the evil , but again , the sacred 精灵 decided to make miracles through with you , even if it &apos;s only a two-week 瞬 , you belong to the sacred 精灵 was evil through the door , you get to , even with miracles is only a two-week 瞬 so you know , we all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
if not , that &apos;s dance , hold you keep jobs , I still kept for you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
if not , that &apos;s dance , hold you keep jobs , I still kept for you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
if you fall in love with projects jobs , that you , hold it worth 嘞 ! you all are cheering you on your way : if you fall in love with projects jobs , that you , hold it worth 嘞 ! you all are cheering you on your way : if you fall in love with projects that you , hold it worth jobs , you all are cheering you on your way : 嘞 ! 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you .

Al Gore from TED in the world , the global climate , think of new trend worth more than about the prophecy scientists , and that ” “ clean coal for him . 
Al Gore warning about the climate recently . 
last year , I &apos;m about to show you two demos the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the equivalent of the size of South America by the 48 state reducing 40 percent . 
but these that can &apos;t high-virus areas of this problem , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
it &apos;s the polar ice cap , like the heart of the climate system . 
in the summer , and actually hyperextending heart . 
I &apos;m going to show you is a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s this dark blue is in a year in annual ice formed in the context of the ice was freezing . 
the so-called ” “ permanent was freezing . I mean , for five or more , you can see the ice , like this body to move blood 各部 guy . 
in that time , 25 years , from here to here . 
that &apos;s worth of the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon and by the letter was freezing . 干冰 clean microbes defrost when methane , carbon . 
if the breakthrough to greenhouse gas emissions , in the atmosphere is the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska , you can see in the lake has been a went out . 
the last winter , at the professor walter alaska 结队 katey light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s how we , right ? 
there &apos;s a reason , the heat of heat the sink Greenland . 
this is the melting of a year . 
but to 往年 than traffic . 
this is the southwest Greenland kangerlussuaq . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rise to the mouth of the Nung it is here . 
here is a dramatic rise in the traffic . 
the other side of the Earth , the big planets , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report to reduce the amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
the third largest himalayas ice in the top , you can see new in the lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
being from the world to 40 percent of the drinking water . 
in the ice , the Andes , this is the city drinking water . 
in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose the water . 
the snow in California , Sierra 40 percent reduction per year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry population decline . 
and the world population is the absolute disaster in the kind of remarkable speed . 
disaster in the last 30 years , in relation to the 七十五年 sums up four times more early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
every day in the past five years we added CO2 七千万吨 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions from the ocean . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India on the continent so dramatically reduce the oxygen in the ocean . 
most of the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , except for the 20 percent , oil fuel is burning . 
oil , coal most urgent , very important . 
the United States and become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to use more to build a planet of carbon coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what &apos;s the new and some of the green alternative solutions . 
so , but it &apos;s a political in our country . 
and the coal carbon and spent the last year in oil industry 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what reminded me . 
before Christmas , in my hometown of billions of Tennessee dig muck up the coal . 
you may have seen in the news . 
the second largest here , put the water . 
in this happens before Christmas 
there &apos;s a carbon -- coal and advertising . 
coal is happy and happiness and cool the avatar . 
and you can see in the United States , more productive , we also helped him productive economic development . 
in every day and cool coal become more clean 
he cute sanctuary for workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s the west , virginia our original of coal . 
that &apos;s the head of Mayors , the coal mining massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy company . and by the company , of energy in the law in a series of the environment , with a major controversies . it &apos;s not in the process of mining along the act of core , 污 pelosi . Al congressman nancy , current and Harry Reid and 议长 energy and business committee chairman congressman . and by two people to Congress to all the energy of a composite with climate bill for this guy , they don &apos;t understand exactly what about 
so , climate protection is Al Gore and alliance , people started to one of the current and two projects . 
this is one part of one of them . 
in a very serious coalergy , we do for us to cause of climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money that we work with and for the first goal of coal version of the truth . 
in fact , are not coal . 
we think , it &apos;s the smell of clean . 
so , don &apos;t have to worry about , and for global warming . 
let us to fix . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s go to look like the art of clean coal factory . 
some spectacular 喧哗 machine . 
but this is the sound of technology , clean coal . 
although burn coal is causing global warming in the main reasons why you see here the amazing technology , the clean coal fascinated people changed everything . 
is this ! look at the clean coal technology is today . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
the economic crisis is in the United States , and national security , climate crisis 
in the crisis of all the strings together for us is based on carbon , like the dirty oil on the product of imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solutions to solve these problems . 
the cleaner america repower with electricity with 100 percent of the decade . 
let &apos;s get new American lives we work , and make better security in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
and finally , a 
this is about repower america . 
in the old dirty oil , this is the murder of our planet to reduce our on the fastest way . 
in the future . here , the wind , solar energy , new networks . 
the more the investment to create a new kind of money . 
when I was america repower ! has . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go faster , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 ago . 
we need to go away , and it is . 
thank you very much . 
the MIT on graduation 梅若 David siftables to -- we show the crackers , you can use my hands , the size of the computer building blocks together . it can be toy advanced arithmetic , playing music , it &apos;s going to talk . it will be the new generation of learning machine ? 
David would think siftables demo -- a toy . 
first , I want to please recall a time , if you have in the building blocks . 
when you how to build with Legos idea , and the hands-on to is actually , when you &apos;re learning how to solve the problem with thinking . this is the 空间结构 to understand and the object . 
understand that we can help very 空间结构 objects around a lot of things to learn . 
so , as a computer scientist , in this field hand-powered inspired by the way of thinking , and the mentor in my partner and I pattie kalanithi affordable , I started to think , is to -- we can replace with a new computer mouse cursor moving than a digital , is the best in fingertips -- that will move desktop ? how can we use hand to directly to the sensory information , we could -- information together to how to do ? 
so the question I would keep in mind , so we decided to find the answer , so it &apos;s only siftables . 
simple siftable is to say , with a computer , the size of the crackers , as well . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable can move , each other , the perception and siftable 每块 monitor and radio device . 
the most important , is the individual &apos;s siftable 每块 , like , you can just as building blocks . 
and the siftables represents a new digital ecosystems -- the tools of information . 
this individual more tools to each other , more sensitive , with any sense , perception of mobile , so we can use this tool to interact with some of the interesting new . 
now , I &apos;ll show you some simple . 
this is like a reflection siftable configuration , if I put it to the side , the image , so that &apos;s what it in this way , if I put it in the opposite direction , and the image , so it in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if you put them out a 挨 , one of the interesting thing is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , they would perceive , that &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can perceive moves , and the other way . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures , like a siftables backwards from a liquid that siftable pour the color of the siftable . 
we look at this , that there are three sets of patterns to paint barrel siftables , we can put these barrel in the middle pour the colors , put that together with color . 
if more upside down , you can go again . 
the machine learning siftables function , and you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is through these -- we want to learn to function faster , on-the-spot to see the results . 
this is my siftables show here -- the reason is that -- with a simple equation , I made the Fibonacci numbers . 
&quot; siftables can play a game -- together with the remix boggle scrabble spell a word games . 
this word together as a way to play the game , you just take the letter with a siftable with dollars , when you put together siftables letters of the words in the dictionary , the siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds after the right to automatically siftables spell a word that change the sequence of the words , right , and you can try to put the letters in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so , now , some of the screen in the Media Lab children are involved in the test siftables kids to experience , I took the process of experience . 
kids love siftables . 
and this is interesting in the game play these words , we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
he &apos;s going to just say a word , this is a game ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen on other people &apos;s siftables experience . 
bottom right corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just wanted to put together in a pile of siftables . 
in his mind , is just siftables kit . 
the screen right now is to interact with the function of animation . 
we want to be learning the language siftables tool . 
this kid called the shot Felix . 
he can put some new images animation to add elements , he can do on the table of siftables is to take a vote images animation for video , you can put these new had to add elements on it . 
see , he had to add up to the Sun . 
the sound of the Sun . 
David now he put it in the Galapagos . 
in orange . 
do good ! 
to shake graphics siftables towards a new element that can take the image to add up to him -- a new element 吠 -- dogs . 
he wrote in his animation of the story . 
hello ! 
this is an open in the end of the story of how a plan , his story . 
sitting in the fly away . 
I &apos;m going to give you one last going to show this function , playing music is even more recently , we kind of siftables , R &amp; D in function , can make sound 超载 frequencies , like the sound of drums and Bess . 
everybody has tiles , regulate for 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put the sound of the modules to sound editors siftable tiles siftable by the way you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors near tiles tiles . 
it &apos;s like a voice 响器 , with the filter siftable tiles . 
the sound of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles . 
so , you can use to control the master rhythm and volume of tiles siftable tiles siftable editing close to adjust rhythm and volume . 
we look at . 
the first started with two editors 超载 note , plus some tiles 超载 . 
now joined 贝斯音 . 
now add some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to put sound filter , tiles Drums tiles that can adjust sound . 
I &apos;m going to need just to accelerate the pace of tiles rhythm to edit tiles . 
now to turn to the filter sound filter tiles tiles . 
in the process of playing music , and can even . 
so don &apos;t need it , even in advance , all based on play , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with play , the tiles volume edited tiles on the left , to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see the ideal is , I developed a new medium to human-computer interaction with the body to better work of the brain . 
today , I showed you in this to the follow-up study siftable , we are in the lab . 
I want to talk to you in the idea is that we developed a new generation cutting-edge technology -- product 接轨 digital media and the technology to bring the world , it will give innovation of this change in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
