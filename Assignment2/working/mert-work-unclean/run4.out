through rapture photos and stories , for National Geographic by Wade Davis explorers of the world extraordinary indigenous to celebrate culture , cultural diversity , this is an alarming rate disappear from the Earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me , traveling around the world and in the anthropology of one of the most fun is the experience of traditional groups that are not forget the breeze , to be in touch rainwater wash 晶莹 light it lobes with the rock hard . you can feel their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 tiger across the Inuit directly to the mythology of that old still notion of empathy , or in following the Himalayas and in the Buddhist 法门 that remind us of the core of the human mind responsibility is it that we live in the world is not an absolute consciousness is just a reality , and it &apos;s a model for sexual choice , and our ancestors in many generations ago to make that choice . 
and of course , we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience of adult would 
we have the brutal 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find the rhythm of culture song and dance has unique signature . 
whether it &apos;s in the jungle Krishna is 伯南人 voodoo in Haiti taught in Northern Kenya 侍僧 or Julius Sue 武士 安迪斯 mountains , desert 巫医 or the middle of the Sahara desert account for a month I used to the hotel people to the desert , he &apos;s a 结伴 牦牛 牧养人 Everest life at the top of the world of the hill . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you will now , a different way of thinking that you see hope . 
the world by 五彩缤纷 犹如 a culture of mental life and culture , the life of the Earth . it &apos;s very important 芸芸众生 of the Earth as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the Internet . 
you can put this culture , the web of life as a race race loop loop , this can be defined as a human that since has been created by imagination , all the ideas and dream 之和 myths and all intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity is very strong as we have the ability to look at the species . 
as the biosphere as of race and facing the same , the destruction of the end , and it faster . 
no one can say a 50 percent or more species extinct in the brink of extinction , or is it because the truth of the most pessimistic biodiversity is far more to the most optimistic cultural diversity . 
this one is the most important language . 
we live on this planet have 6 : 00 native language 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is the human spirit , shining 
it &apos;s actually the unique culture in the spirit of the world 承 therapy . 
each one is a language that an ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate . 
we know the Earth &apos;s six : 00 language that number , and we all these different languages in half no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that do work unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you &apos;re going to say one last 本族语 . no way of reconnecting ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , is a terrible about every two weeks on the planet will be with a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
I know some people say that you wouldn &apos;t be better ? if you only have a language that &apos;s not better ? so I want to say that this is the language of the Yoruba or 粤语 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop , you have overall , and you personally feel are lose civilization . 
there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot I said “ different way of living ” I said ” “ different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in the Northwest 亚玛逊 in Arabic is that they &apos;re called 蚺 of a political race because they believe that they 米尔克 coming from the of the sacred about snakes . 
this can &apos;t tell the difference between groups of people in the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 and so in their and no difference in the forest canopy 
they said , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 called a linguistics 通婚 异族 people with a different language to the people get married . 
this is based on the history of mythology and you can see through a strange phenomenon , because of the wedding 异族 often have a very 六七种 language you never see 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was working with in the Northeast Ecuador 华拉尼 race to the genocide is one of the most amazing in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five years , the missionaries 1957 to them , but these people trying to make a mistake . 
they dropped from the air , they have eight to 十张 . we think this is kind of , but they don &apos;t think these people live in water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through trying to find these people , but what they found that the person , so they don &apos;t think this is a call to Devil . and they use it with five missionary 戮 die . 
it &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 external 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
do we survey found only 一个八代 宗谱 两例 natural death we 刨根问底 they finally , the truth , and the same old people . it &apos;s going to wood , they will die he 送终 戮 for him . 
the other hand , they have the 惊诧 revealed . 
they can smell of a predator 40 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I used to take a fantastic job at Harvard University professor , I asked if I &apos;m interested in Haiti , to go to a secret club that &apos;s the president and his Haiti 杜华利 support the base of the regime professor , I went to make it a 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand , I have to figure out of this amazing religious voodoo taught how to teach a voodoo magic is the dark . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s interesting . 
if I want you to list some important religion in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
there &apos;s a continent still a lot of people think forgotten sub-Saharan Africa , no religion that is not right in the era of famine , these nomadic people around the world of religion to teach and voodoo there &apos;s the essence of these religions . 
voodoo unique about it was born with the connection between 
in living soul . 
the dance 大水 to tap the rhythm can replace the soul for a living soul in that moment for 侍僧成 flash of light . 
so voodoo who say you go to church worship like to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach evident trance 侍僧 into a state of de-animation the branches of a sudden , but worse for wear when they enter the state of hyperactivity extreme , you &apos;ll see more amazing phenomenon make you feel powerful resilience . 
in my community of life in Colombia in all of the mountains in northern 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
this is the tyranny in ancient civilization they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of a isolated in plain . 
in this bloody ethnic globe continent that has never been to the people . 
and today , they will along with monk 续 rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
and the only have three young 侍僧 is take away from their families in the dark gone on the bottom of the stones into the house for two 十八年 to nine years of age , and it &apos;s a symbol of the 40,000 fetuses in utero during 怀胎 in September . 
they like to go back to groups 母腹 taught the values that maintain these values , and with the universe is the relationship between the believers , we can call it the balance . 
until they age of this amazing when they first came out of his house to see the sun in the ground present mind-blowingly spectacular beauty that moment , and their families before that all the abstract knowledge is an amazing honor in the rabbi recognized and see me . I used to teach you is true . 
here &apos;s how you want to protect it beautiful . 
they call themselves for lies for over , we say we are in the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
people say to the original 风土人情 土族 , and we want to be the noble to Russell about time that the ancient 野人 an ideal racist Thoreau we think about these people , more than we close . 
it will not 多愁善感 Aboriginal people would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
in the prevailing 阿斯玛 wetlands malaria in the wind , not many 刺骨 of Tibet land on this kind of rough terrain , but they are just in the power of the skill of creating miracles , it &apos;s not because they consciously recognize this with very sensitive , and they think the intuition in this world , because of human nature that can absorb . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can live for a child in the Andes adults when he said , the mountain taught 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them . they are completely different type of people with the environment , and they 生养 of a different relationship , and in Montana , a young rock is just a bunch of them can be used to open 采石 mine . 
whatever it is a mountain , or just a bunch of 矿石 . it &apos;s not important . 
this is really important for the relationship between the people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , by the local people thought , I think is going to be the deforestation . 
this idea , a tribe , and one of my friends , has to be two groups of people because they believe that these trees are heaven 胡克神 and eat the eye of the avatar 精灵 north in the world in a bar mitzvah Hama Caesar on which they will with these 精灵 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find these culture create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life . 
this picture last year in August , I was in the Northwest Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
dead on the water is not the amazing is that it &apos;s amazing medicinal sex and it actually is processed by one , two , it &apos;s a matter of 藤本植物 -- with β 咔 啉 蓬 硷 and small amounts of phantom then when you sit down on the cane is it seems to me , you can see a blue smoke it with a wooden 九节 for coffee promiscuous , that &apos;s all in the bush . 
this is a potent dopamine in the color of the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 from the people with serotonin , plants extract nose and continuing with this . 
if you use a powder suck in these hallucinations , you &apos;ll see these wacky , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you , but not distorted 荡然无存 
in fact , I was with my mentors Richard Evan shultes the debate in the 1930s , my mentor , in Mexico to find a magic mushrooms are very strong psychedelic . I used to debate , and he said , you can &apos;t belong to the color dopamine psychedelic category then when you sit down , because when they play in you , you &apos;ve been working to psychedelic can experience . 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
the color dopamine to oral substance to change a single oral 氧化酶 dopamine , and the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in the 藤本植物 咔 啉 β -- there was going to be able to control dopamine agonists 氧化酶 and play the potency of color , so you ask yourself , everyone must 
this is in the &apos; 80s : 00 a plant that is how people are not in the form of plants , linked together to play this amazing power of this experiment in as a biological effect than all the chemical 之和 in power . 
we do all kinds of experiments that ordinary people to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask Indians said they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
people 科凡 tribes that all the cane is they die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to have some plants . 
you know , there are certain plants , and I said , is not . 
I tell you that if they said in the months circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that would not let you get a Ph.D. in Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a problem , and some of us with indigenous people think that compassion 离群索居 enrich their lives , but as we develop these people in the world forward to the edge of back in history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , people will remember this time of the war , and it &apos;s technology or innovation that we will remember that in the era of positive , for the Earth to the ecological and cultural diversity of mass destruction , or passively accept this situation , where still didn &apos;t change now . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians , even though it still is the Great Sioux Nation with Indians and the horse and carriage courtesy of life is still in the United States . 
the threat is not race intact change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of . 
look at the world around us , you don &apos;t have a culture is destined to extinction of the rich people had been raped energy out of the power of the 生养 they feel uncomfortable for them to make their ceaseless energy , whether it &apos;s 伯南 heartland of deforestation and forest of the Southeast Asia , they pull 游民 tribes of free and roam and pick up the people in the jungle , and to live in now for 仆役 and prostitutes have 沦落 . you can see in the water and soil , it seems to half the 罗族 南中国海 冲走 to live in Japan , where people are ready to go to sail cargo ship from the forest and cut down the circle of wood and Jamie 亚诺马 tribes that in there , because people were gold . 
we look at in Tibet recently where I do a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of the way of life , but no denunciations crimes in many places it even as part of the praise strategy by . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with 
and I was a young colleagues from China Northwest 成都市 go after six : 00 miles southeast of Tibet journey through to when I arrived in during during the time to really understand what you heard about the statistics of behind the hidden in the Cultural Revolution 6 : 00 temple by the largest 120 million people were killed backbone Communist Party . 
this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
the Chinese people immediately after he was killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together to Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
he was only two , and he put his mother quietly in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister , because the behavior , and just by 学习班 
one day she didn &apos;t have to be stuck on the president of the hairs 臂章 and being in the country for seven years of 劳教 . 
the pain of Tibet and redemption to withstand human need to get to see . 
and we &apos;ll have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead before she had said in the most worried about is because we &apos;ve come into this kind of their native worldview we not only see the human imagination more 陕 隘 in the community , and one day we waking up to forget the world there are other possibilities . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve 60 drained . it &apos;s going to make us feel guilty . 
human time 新石器 into an agricultural revolution , we would like to seed Beijerinck 腊 萨满 poetry is the rabbi . we create a level of all of this 社会分工 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
in my view of history and the short enough to have the capacity for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we ask the culture of this different meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully know the species that we have to make sure that all 昌盛 prosperity race , and all of life . 
this picture was taken in the northern part of the mountain 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 to the people I talk about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family of his security to worry about all the weapons and tools he took . 
you know , the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the thick of God . 
they sled of the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man doesn &apos;t fear the grandfather of the night and 凛冽 . 
he slept on the outside in his skin his shit seal 长裤 when shit faster to fingers stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 after it becomes very frozen solid after he &apos;ve dealt with this dog knife . 
the skin off a dog 挽具 he made out of a dog sleds chest condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t put that in a knife shit on the ice . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all of the world of 顽强 indigenous life becomes real . 
1999 to a government four months Canada than the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions , New Le 
this is a independent of where they control all of the ocean . 
this is very good example of a country that could do something with it , to repair the relationship between the people . 
and I think that ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our children &apos;s dream of the world as part of the future of hope . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people think about it , but we can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the site of the month we click thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
we &apos;re going to do is journey through a series of race to the circle of our audience to see a miracle of culture , they &apos;re going to see everything they can &apos;t help but feel powerful , and we hope to him and entertain pollen more inclusive , these cultural anthropology , is the core of the world need diversity reveals the survival of the way we can actually live in a multicultural race to the world for all the wisdom of all want to make human well-being . 
thank you . 
the Y arcas blaise aguera photosynth demo of this stunning , watching this software that could change the way we use digital images from the . pick static photosynth stunning photos , created the and dream , and one of them . 
blaise arcas photosynth agueray . 
first of all , I &apos;m going to use the fastest speed show you some new technology , the basic research is a year ago , Microsoft acquired our company , and we for Microsoft with this technology , it &apos;s a software seadragon . seadragon environment , you can use it to 近景 or vision to browse the vastness of visualizing the data . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of our digital photographs , and they can continue to the full of by the way , you can look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
no matter how many see images of data , and there &apos;s a lot of itself , images have this seadragon processing capability . 
so most of the picture is taken by digital camera , but this is a picture of , it &apos;s a different from the Library of Congress , like 3亿个 scan the picture . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just the screen , you &apos;re using like seadragon 素数 . and it &apos;s a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image of the data . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I gave you that this is really not text and images like this , we can , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s a way to read the book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more , and this is an example of The Guardian . 
each one is a picture starts did . 
and the newspaper or itself contains paper version of proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading reading experience , to enjoy . 
here we do this in a small change issues to &quot; The Guardian corner . 
we fiction advertising a high-resolution picture you see this -- this is the normal high resolution advertising , to a lot of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , you can see here . 
you can see , even technology version of the other dimensions . 
in this way of actually avoid the use of the screen . 
we want to be able to reduce this technology played out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made their own . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and to deal with the top of the road map . 
now , we put these , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go to experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different technology : . 
one is , and the other , seadragon from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely that the computer vision . this research seitz Washington University , Steve . 
and Rick Microsoft Institute of szeliski . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this has applications in the Internet , it &apos;s based on building seadragon technology . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way to look at pictures , and to do at more nuanced and have resolution to experience . 
these images , but in the space is actually a very meaningful . 
these images computer vision algorithms to connect together , so these images can be a real space , and in this space , we took these pictures -- these are the Rockies , in Canada , and pull the lakes 西湖 grassi . -- all the picture is taken in here . so you can see here is the elements was full of hope , or MRI , and this is in space . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of sense of more than this space . 
so let &apos;s look at last summer , we use one of the early noah photosynth database of what the beginning of the model . I think it &apos;s definitely the technology we 抢眼 . this technology , not just like we show the website that simple . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
here is the Flickr website images of Paris Notre Dame . you &apos;re going to do is on the site in Flickr input “ Notre Dame ” in Paris , and then you can see a lot of pictures , including the photograph alleys , etc . , all these orange color represents a cone to build models . 
these are all the images from Flickr , this was 串联 in space . 
and then we can so easily , to browse . 
and in fact , I never thought I would end to work for Microsoft . 
by this pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see from these images , a lot of the camera phone camera , from a single to the quality of different . so , in this all together in the environment . 
let me get some pictures of a weird . 
see , the contains a lot of pictures visitors 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here -- should have a series of photos , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster of the environment . 
here &apos;s the point that we can work with the community . we can get from everybody to different data to memory of the environment , collect together to build models . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , a much more than just to take all . 
this model menacing , what is the whole planet . 
and it &apos;s Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth long tail market . &quot; 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , went on to you . 
if people are willing to all of these Notre Dame , 圣贤 in that tag on who they are , that we have a picture of the rich Notre Dame , and then , we can for starting with this picture , into this space , this picture of a lot of people by what the virtual world , to build a model , across across the user interface . 
and of course , that all of a valuable and what is a very rich model -- this is interesting every corner of the landscape . these landscape and not just the satellite images , but really people pressing the shutter 一刻所 collection of the collective memory . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
. this is actually the software is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this process is completely 接合 based on the content . 
the more exciting is a picture of text semantic contains information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type of the word , will have a lot of text with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , the image with you ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s incredible ! congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist 施瓦茨 Western society in a center for the principles -- the freedom of choice . it started in 施瓦茨 more that we have more freedom , we get to the paralyzed . they don &apos;t we feel happy , to bring more not satisfied . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to from a of principles . 
what kind of principles ? 
the whole industry is Western society , not by 笃信 a credo . 
that &apos;s the principles : if we want to make people to get the benefits of the way , is to maximize individual liberty . 
why is this thing and freedom is good , to value , for people . 
and once people have freedom , we can use to 做主 all the benefits , don &apos;t have to get people 做主 for me . 
the freedom to make a way that &apos;s the selectivity of . 
the choice of the people , more and more freedom , freedom , get more and more of it . 
I think this idea , like so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in that nobody wanted to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas and deep embedded in our daily lives . 
let me give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say the salad ingredients . 
I have this pronouncement salad ingredients 175种 supermarket , there &apos;s the first 10 different would have specialized sign 榨 olive oil and vinegar 12 balsamic grapes any 选购 , if you happen to that 175种 salad spaghetti sauce , and you don &apos;t , you can use them hook to another a large number of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets . 
and then you turn out to a one to store it a three-dimensional stereo system -- a speaker , CDs , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a pop-up stores do one in stereo system is countless more . 
with this store , you can make the components of 650万种 closer together with the three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you want to refer to phone service , and that is to just Maya Bell , a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
often the case , it &apos;s not going to die . 
that day 一去不返 already . 
now I almost infinite variety of mobile phone , especially -- that cartoons . 
these are the cell phone . 
I love is one of the middle of the same MP3 play -- with a cut hair , and French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next shops seen , don &apos;t have to worry about , not how you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : you have a function of not so much ? 
you want to answer is , what ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in life , more than the other shopping thing for us , this effect of the Big Bang . 
health care in the United States , right now -- is that you don &apos;t go to the doctor , who tells you how to do so time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment , can also use nail 乙 . 
and so forth , and make a solution nail risk . 
and so forth , and make a solution 乙 risk ? how do you want to cure . 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
doctors said nail , again , and these are very , very 乙 those risk and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , but I don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
the result is what we say “ patients municipalities . ” sounds like a pretty good . that &apos;s actually do bear responsibility to and from a know how to do , I mean , to a doctor 转嫁 treatments , and that &apos;s what doesn &apos;t require , decided to do in the state of people , that &apos;s the patient . 
now all of a prescription drugs that ad is for you . I of the ordinary people , if you think about it . and since we say isn &apos;t buy directly to the counter . 
why do they do . we need to market ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call , the doctor in a prescription drugs . 
now , like the gender of the identity of this , we have a choice . it &apos;s like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we can to shape their gender of identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you want to do a kind of women and men is the decision . 
in the family in the last marriage , everybody &apos;s got married . this is the age of things , and then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
you need the choice is not and who are married , and when I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of smart students good , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , one of the fifth . 
it &apos;s not because they were dumb , students . it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , I always ask yourself : what should or shouldn &apos;t get married ? should I now ? 
and after I was trying to kids , let &apos;s first career knew ? 
this is the problem of 脑筋 . 
they have to answer these questions , whether they do not do I work , whether they &apos;re I take a class . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can in one day , any time in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , where you can actually have a wireless online , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
we say , the incredible work that we have the freedom of choice is that we have to make decisions and choices , again , again , again , now for their work , and it &apos;s about . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 the mobile phone , and the other 裤兜 blackberry with BlackBerry , and still holding lap laptops . 
even if they closed , we are looking at the same in rivals for children and ask yourself , this is not the phone ? 
go back to this email or not ? I don &apos;t have to write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no child , you know , this is the experience of the game is big compromised . . 
look around , big , whether it &apos;s the matter is lifestyle choice , life is . 
over the world we live . 
that means , choice is still there is nothing , but don &apos;t need to choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the problem is , this is what is a good thing or bad ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
one , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we have to choose . it &apos;s not the box , but is paralysis . 
people with so many choices that very difficult to make a decision . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan for investment in terms of his retirement income . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest in vanguard . vanguard is a big companies have about a foundation , millions of people , and two 000多个 office . 
she survey found is that when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every increase of 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose , so that it &apos;s even more difficult and you just put tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow , Tomorrow &apos;s halide , of course , you would never come tomorrow . 
we know it means that when people to retire , may have only use 充饥 dog food , because they don &apos;t have enough money to draw the future , and make a decision , because it &apos;s so hard to even employer , that they are fairly impressive . it &apos;s all the symmetrical for a grant give up . 
this is not to plan for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so , it &apos;s too much choice is paralysis . 
it makes us so that the world looks like this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose a foundation , or wrong is salad ingredients . 
thank you . it &apos;s the first negative . let &apos;s talk about in the second , even though I try to overcome rigid and paralysis and finally made a right , we decided to make decisions and we can choose more sexual 少时 decisions . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
one is , the salads ingredients so many species , if you buy a , think about , you &apos;re very easy to imagine if you pick a . okay ? this massive influx of choice , and you have to make you feel regret regret , to make you feel that you used to make a choice , happiness , even though it was a very good choice . 
the more choices , the inexplicably for some things to feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction to make choices . 
and second , is what economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert is about a enough , we see a value on things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of options , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you choose to give up the people that you . this is one that you think of 美中不足 . 
an example of that . and if you , New York , I said , a 歉 
but this is what you should think right now . 
look at this two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
or better than this ? this point in “ huh , to really bad , ” “ ” in August , is now . 
“ Manhattan neighbors don &apos;t ” at home . 
I &apos;m going to be “ can to stop back to my own ” door . 
for two weeks , and he was a idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the opportunity . 
” “ opportunity cost , we have always decided to make that decision not happy , even if it &apos;s actually quite remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things are , the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but , a sense is , when you choose to do something that choice , you don &apos;t do it . 
these are the things that you have a lot of places to decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
in this time I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
the last , jeans is that a pattern , you don &apos;t buy , pants , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to washed so many times , get 凑合 pants . 
so , this years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new “ . I said , I want to feed a jeans , this is the size of the ” I . 
and said , you have to type , the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
to the front of his buttons . there is locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
that grinds them to faster ? 
it &apos;s the back , and the ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw almost off . and I got over , and I said , I &apos;m going to “ that was the only ” a pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I spent a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a I never 合身 pants out the store . 
I don &apos;t do it . these choices that I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse , the reason is because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a much better jeans , what should be a good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when a jeans is so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I had to me , and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
people together in life , except for things that can improve people &apos;s expectations are not good for people outside that many benefits . 
the result is just to make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
there &apos;s nobody to market to understand this . because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what it is . I mean , I mean . 
that &apos;s it like this : a belief in all the bad things are better than now . 
when one of the reason is that people could have good experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , industrial civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every one of the things you can only hope it &apos;s not more than you would expect . 
what you can &apos;t be surprised , because what you expect than my God . 
what is happiness , this is the secret of you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
this thing , I didn &apos;t 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 is not necessarily a bad thing . 
and finally , don &apos;t buy a 合身 jeans is one of the shops , when there &apos;s only a pattern can buy , you feel happy , why don &apos;t want to know who , back to that responsibility ? the answer was clear . the world is responsible . what do you have to do ? 
now there are hundreds of jeans in store for you , you buy a choice , not come back , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
on out there with hundreds of excuses jeans , you don &apos;t make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even decided to do that , and they &apos;re very good -- is to be disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past in this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and explosive growth in clinical trials , depressing . 
I believe that if the suicide explosive growth and an important , is not the only factor , but it &apos;s important is that all of those disappointing . why is the standard is too high . when they have to explain these experiences what &apos;s going on , they think this is the wrong their own . 
and finally , the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
this is the choice of happiness principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
choice no better than no choice , but not the more choices this picture . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond our ’ ‘ choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many choices , is a matter of . 
we have a lot of places in the world , at least , we heard a few of them , there &apos;s not too much . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic modern Western societies is rich in a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday said indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated , it &apos;s not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not from ago . 
if we put this society to create these choices part of the system to get people into the now not enough to the society , not only can get the lives of people there , and we also get quality of life . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us , like plague of extra choice . 
before the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a position “ guy , huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have -- I first saw this painting that it is . 
but I want to feel more clearly must know what this fish . 
because if you want to be honest everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is , is the paralyzed . 
everyone needs a fish “ ” . 
and this is a fish . so , for this fish is small , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , there &apos;s a symbolic suffering , it means to fish , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
“ from the digital world , we can create new life ? ” Craig Venter . he said , the answer is “ can ” and very quickly . he &apos;s about his recent research and commitment to make very soon we will not have the ability to activate a chromosome . 
Craig Venter to artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve talked about some of these projects about the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new design biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists to try to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the small components . 
now we &apos;ve used to almost 20 years to digital . when we in the human genome sequence of biology , it &apos;s the world from analog computer analysis September the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can life , or whether we went from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . here , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome in the lab to replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from 500组 一百组 genes that we make these . 
but when we look at it metabolism , this is actually relatively simple relative to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple . but when we look at all , we can separate these , one of the genome , it &apos;s hard to believe it can create a living cells . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change it to continue the part of the most basic questions . 
so we started to walk along this path “ we can ” synthetic chromosomes ? 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in the pace of exponential speed . 
the genetic code to write our progress very slowly , but to also increase in the . we just going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it was for the first stage . we do in the first time , the biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a process of the back , the fragments , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first Phi X 174 , from the genome and phage digital information . 
it &apos;s a small can kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes , it &apos;s wrong , and have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
another phase of the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t live chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill a different 兰氏 E. coli and negative fungus . 
I recently with some of the oil industry , and I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually software can build a biological system in the hardware . 
but we still want to expand . we want to make the entire bacterial chromosomes , a symbol of 580 , more than 10,000 genes code . and we think we should be in the size of viruses make ” “ box that they can we change these ” “ box to understand a living cell is actually part of what ? 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer . that started using digital information to the digital information . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , the gene sequencing for every 10,000 is basically a mistake . 
in fact , we found , again , the average 30 sequence is wrong . if we use the genetic sequence , this would never have turned on . 
design is part of the work of design than 50 character and the other 50 character long to build smaller pieces of the time . we need to design , they can together . 
one of the design of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments enzyme cut some enzymes bias . they used to repair , and they put together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to make people 24 , and symbol than the length of time , getting out at the time . 
at every stage , we had a lot of culture that sequence , so we can give them , because we want to create a very reliable process , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we try to get automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep in the coil . for longer . try to do in the modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology to repair the DNA , it can put together than 
here &apos;s an example of a microbial called resistant to be able to withstand radiation 球菌 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it in all the chromosomes . 
12 to 24 hours later , and it back to the combination of before . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes to be completely out of water . they can in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there &apos;s life , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule . these microscopic through the process , which is what the yeast in front of the way through , and we put it into the design of the right . they talk to the yeast automatically . 
this is not an image microscopic ; it &apos;s just ordinary optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule , we can take a look at it optics microscope . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the trial . 
this is more than the genetic code 580000 character . it &apos;s not by humans setting the structure of the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t 10-point font distance to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus is a very simple bacteria with more complicated . 
we deal with this really like a biological and relatively simple one , and you can take the cells into another , this is what you hear about cloned . 
for the bacteria , they chromosome 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant cells , the chromosome from one to another cells and activate it . 
the microbes from a species we extract chromosomes . basically , it &apos;s like the difference between humans and mice . we add some new genes that we can choose those chromosomes . we use them to get enzyme , from all the proteins when we put it into the cells , . pretty amazing you should be like what we make very sophisticated images -- . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this just that . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species or chromosome , the third place in the thousands and thousands of seconds , a new features to it . 
people who were in the process of evolution and just a genetic change ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of the cells , no , no and enzymes , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it out , and recognize that the chromosome out of matter , it &apos;s to digest , and we have to have a new DNA . 
we put it into a gene causing blue . 
in a very short period of time , out of the characteristics of all species , and completely gone into a new species , we put the new software ” “ cells . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is that we actually implant . 
this might sound like alchemists turning discord genes , but we can shift , through DNA to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on the evolution of 3.5 billion years . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life emerged a design based on this digital new species . 
why do that ? 
I think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own , I was born in 1946 . 
now in the world &apos;s three people in every one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , into four . 
we &apos;re 65亿 food for people , clean fresh water , all the fuel , very difficult . 
that &apos;s a nine billion people in 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program or any can replace it , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material in the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
we found from around the world , there &apos;s about a database of 两千万组 genes , and I just love them as the future of design components . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry , and look to components that can get diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because what we call these can make a group of “ chromosome synthetic ” quickly . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a chromosome . 
when you think of different 两千万组 processed this gene , and try to optimize the steps that 制剂 辛烷 or create drugs , and new vaccines , and we can change , even a small team , can do what science than the last 20 years of doing molecular biology more work . 
and this is just the standard . we can choose to survive , the ability to fuel the chemical production , or production , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is , we actually sit in the computer to really design software design species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you see a recently corn ethanol is going into a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
but we think the only biology can make a huge impact and increased food , and not limit . it can use to is that if we can start using CO2 as a material of it . so we &apos;re designing a new cells development in this path . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
and one of the CO2 is a way -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a by that , in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the source of energy . 
if we look at the two to collect their , they get very convenient , can be introduced into process , fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can increase the life for ? &quot; &quot; what are the basic problem . 
we replace the whole oil industry a little good . but if you can &apos;t do that , at TED , where there ? can be a major source . 
and we also use the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you see this all the flu , we &apos;re always going on in time and a year , the lack of money , when the vaccine . 
I think this is through a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species of bacteria , nuclear is really have such an artifact for the biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a better life away from humans and on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough time , maybe you can do that . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox which shares some super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : what the LHC out ? 
last year at TED I introduced the LHC . 
and I said , you must go back to update . it is the machine . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we use these little changes to probe the Big Bang . 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a picture of a atlas . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first picture clusters of particles around all the LHC , as we all along with the LHC plan , in part of a lot of particles go 辐 detectors . 
in other words , when we see in September the 10th of this machine . we know it works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know is that this is a 满堂喝彩 or Google -- when people to see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work on this with the culture of science as a shock . 
but about a week later , we machine out of the main point with these 导线 导线 about -- the Golden Desert . 
these 导线 conduction when they all 安培 current . 
now some of you might say “ engineers , not too little ” these wires . 
they can do because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so below minus 271摄氏度 planet in between the temperature of the space of these 导线 can transmission of electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a technology 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of a sudden they conduction 安培 current by resistance 
this is . 
very shocking , because the magnet material they move weighs about a mile rule . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
to put them unloaded , the work done . 
we give them , it out . 
now , back to them . 
in about three to refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to start it , and in six July to get the data , and we find out the mission of the most basic units . 
now , obviously , again , one of these accidents so frontier of science and engineering , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think it &apos;s too difficult task , but we still projects of itself , and that &apos;s the value of the LHC . 
and I want to a British scientists 复述 戴维翰 warren , and I remember , as an apprentice on his own defense meaningless experiment -- he &apos;s an apprentice , Michael 法拉 -- said , for the human brain development , nothing more than this dangerous idea : think we have to understand science as a mystery of everything the human beings have been so stop 全胜 to explore new . 
thank you . 
for those incredibly great social often contemporary art , thanks to the author , for people to a genius , beyond unusual . Elizabeth Gilbert for this to explore and thinking , 独到 for creating genius : that &apos;s one other “ ” a genius , than in his or her in a genius with the help of “ ” . this talk , vivid , interesting colors and personal with 令人感动 . 
Elizabeth Gilbert 呵护 . creativity and writing about reduce stress . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , but nonetheless , a specific event recently in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
this particular event is : I published that the latest 回忆录 &quot; food &quot; pray , love , and this particular event is : I published that the latest 回忆录 , pray , the , &quot; I love with a very generic work that somehow , like the book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller . 
now , whether it &apos;s where people are , I think this is the result is that life , and no matter where people are , I think this is my life . 
so , really , is completely , saved , 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very worried and said to me , and you don &apos;t afraid of “ ? not beyond that . you don &apos;t have that book ” ? 
you don &apos;t “ . would you like this life forever and also , don &apos;t work that love ? ” “ you don &apos;t you all of this , you don &apos;t always love wrote that work ? ” “ you don &apos;t you all of this , you don &apos;t always love wrote that work ? ” “ you don &apos;t you all of this , but never wrote that you don &apos;t love ” work ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was very difficult to date , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , I decided to become a writer , of the things that would be very difficult , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , decided to become a writer . I was a teenager , I was around the same question , people say , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
I was being met the same question , people say , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of bearing down upon to you ? 
you don &apos;t afraid of what life is to have a ? you don &apos;t have to life . but what ? you into the broken dream of going to die in despair , with the pain in the last thing you will die broken dream of despair , in the center of the failure . 
and you will die broken dream of despair , in the center of the things I was always get question . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
yes , all this kind of scary , until today . 
actually , except that , I &apos;m afraid not many people think that this was a lot of people , I don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? 
what &apos;s creative work , that &apos;s how we worry about mental health for each other ? creative work up there , and that &apos;s how we worry about mental health for each other ? other industries , it &apos;s not too , is this ? 
for example , my dad was a chemical engineers in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he became the chemistry of engineers in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he had a chemical engineers . 
no one said , &quot; John , chemical “ met bottleneck work ? ” ? 
it could never ask . 
and of course , 平心而论 chemical engineer this group , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 global , and not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 down the writer , and we actually have the reputation that not only the writers , creative people seem to have very stable 恶名 emotions , not only the writers , creative people seem to have very stable 恶名 . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses 英年早逝 creativity is always the case before died . 
even if the suicide , they don &apos;t show the talent , even if the suicide , they don &apos;t show talent . 
the 曼梅 died , in the last time I said , in every book “ all 蚕食 ” part of me . 
my work for you , this is , how radical . 
but we wanted to 视若无睹 story , because we already , but we wanted to 见怪不怪 story , because we already 视若无睹 见怪不怪 and somehow , people are totally accepted within this idea . this is : creativity and ideas pain , art and to create this would be extremely 苦闷 : creativity and ideas is suffering , art and to create will be extremely 苦闷 
today I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask you today is this : you are not exceptions , right ? 
you think this ? no problem , even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further away from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in 
this terrible 可憎 , and not only , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this terrible 可憎 , and not only , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century 可憎 , and that &apos;s not , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
I think we encouraged the great geniuses continue to be alive . 
and I myself , believed that is due to me in the dark , and I believed that is due to me , especially in the dark in my career stage right now , especially in my career . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , 40 years old , I . 
I have about the next 40 years of career 
and probably , from this moment , I write a piece of will be used to and I was an incredibly tragic event in a book of compare , isn &apos;t it ? will be used to and I was an incredibly tragic event in a book of compare , isn &apos;t it ? 
and frankly , we see in this talk , I said , quote , and friends , the heart , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , this is what the idea . 
is this idea , which is on a 大清早 -- not to have a way , is this idea , which is on a 大清早 drinking wine on the road , not -- I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to go into that I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
after a deep in my view , to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance themselves from writing , and I work for responses from the anxiety writing itself , and my response to the anxious . 
a year ago , I can find in the history of reference , find in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and in different cultures , to find a year ago , I can find in the history of reference , find in different culture , to see if they have better , more than we rational to help with the idea of what art 艺术工作者 inherent in emotional risk of 艺术工作者 art to help with what &apos;s the emotional risk . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because we &apos;ll go back to the problem . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , of creativity is a sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable from distant and unknowable purpose to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks common to call this with the for creativity to “ ” 精灵 stewards for 
and people often think there &apos;s a Socrates stewards for that gives him , from a common wisdom was that people think there &apos;s a Socrates stewards for that gives him , from a distance . 
people have similar ancient Rome , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called ” “ genius 
this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think ” “ genius is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful Rome , because people don &apos;t think ” “ genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
they think is a wonderful ” “ genius of the sacred “ ” genius even think they live in an artist &apos;s studio walls , like a little more than they 精灵 “ genius even think ” artist living in the walls of the studio , like little 精灵 than they would come quietly , glass artists to help on work , and they would come 成败 quietly , glass artists to help , and work 成败 . 
this is a view , this is that I was looking for this safe distance from work is to protect the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand it , is not work ? 
by this ancient artists , and get the protection of ancient artist narcissistic by this idea , and get protection of narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know you &apos;re in a kind of genius “ ” help done . 
if you work really bad , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is in the past , Westerners for a long time about creativity . 
and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea , and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea : let &apos;s take “ human heart , in the universe beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown “ ” human heart , in the universe beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown space ” never leave the gremlin who will deliver sacred . 
this is the beginning of humanism is rational , people start to believe that human creativity that completely from rational individuals itself is the beginning of humanism , people start to believe that human creativity that completely from rational individuals itself is the beginning of humanism , people start to believe that it comes from human creativity , individual itself . 
the first time ever , people will “ ” artists called a genius , and not have a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will “ ” artists called a genius , and not have a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will “ ” artists called a genius , and not have a ” “ genius 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
for one person , a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and all of these things , and he &apos;s otherwise completely normal to swallow in the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
he &apos;s otherwise completely normal to swallow in the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
this is a completely distorted the self , and for people to make . that was completely distorted of a people , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of artists get this pressure , I think , is in the last 500 years of devouring artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least I think this is so the question is : we do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : we do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the old reference for the past , and they go to understand human creativity ? maybe we should go back to the old reference for the past , and they go to understand human creativity ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 ideas of the reason we can &apos;t use a short talk , 18 minutes off the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind . 
and maybe in the audience today , you can ask that question , maybe they are grounded in evidence of science and the audience today , they are grounded in evidence that people can ask this question of science 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on this idea of water ridiculous 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous ideas . 
maybe I can convince you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
that &apos;s all kinds of creative process of uncertainty , the theory of 精灵 theory , and I heard all other theories or a reasonable , but as irrational as this 精灵 theory , and I heard all other theories or a reasonable , but as irrational as . 
this process , for any trying to make people believe that in there that you would know the creative process and not always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s common beyond 
for example , I see the spread of the great poet silk . 斯通 bowhead silk 九十多岁 , she has been a poet and she said she teenagers in Virginia when a life of the things that she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance . 
like , on a breath of emptying down at her . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
now , when she was the only thing to do with the only thing she said , is really to ” “ dashed across 
and she would go home , dashed across this poem after her would go home , she would dashed across this poem after all , to her , she explained to find a pen and paper , in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , put it in the paper that she explained to find a pen and paper , in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem , put it in the paper that she explained to find a pen and paper , in this capture through her , that &apos;s a poem that , put it on paper 
sometimes she , it wasn &apos;t fast enough to run , she didn &apos;t home , and that &apos;s a poem Pentium , so she would miss that crazy , a poem , she didn &apos;t home , and that &apos;s a poem Pentium , so she would miss the poem and she said , it will continue to swimming in fields , looking for a poet ” “ next poem , and she said that will continue to move in fields , between the “ ” for a poet . 
in another , this is the most amazing part , called me in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part of something , and she said she are almost 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running home , looking for a pen and paper that poem is going to go through her , she was through it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and that &apos;s a poem is going to go through her , she was in it through the creation and grab the other hand , she &apos;s a poem , grab that tail , and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the beginning , the last word go by , and the word . 
just sequence is upside down , from the beginning , the last word go by , and the word I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , the creative process , I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , the creative process . 
I heard her story and , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I don &apos;t work , I was more like a so . 
and of course , it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I don &apos;t work , I was way more like a day , so I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work every day , I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get devoted to work . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get an incredible inspiration , but even 古板 occasionally , I would like to get an accident . 
in a lot of people might have similar experience . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration , even if you want to 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
how do we want to see it in the way , not rational ? we have lost in the way to see how it will not rational , loss ? 
I know contemporary artists , with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 I know contemporary artists , with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 a few years ago , I was a magazine , and his job interview we talk about this problem . 
a few years ago , I was a magazine , and his job interview we talk about this problem is with Tom or the stress of modern artists or Tom &apos;s typical of the stress of modern artists to create a typical spend time , and he was trying to control , management and control over that can &apos;t spend time in inspiration , he was trying to control , management and control over that can &apos;t spend time in inspiration , he was trying to control , management and that can &apos;t control over the creative inspiration . 
but the older , or he becomes 敛 沉静 within a day , he told me , he highways in Los Angeles , and drive happened that changed his life , he told me , one day he highways in Los Angeles , and drive happened that changed his life . 
he &apos;s going to speed up , suddenly , he half heard a little bit of the melody ♪ ♪ forward , and he is accelerating , half heard a little bit of this beautiful ♪ ♪ melodies and rhythms intractable into his mind , like , unpredictable inspiration temporary violin , and this melody intractable tempting to his mind , like , unpredictable inspiration temporary violin , and he was tempting to want to capture it , but no , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder pen and paper . 
he desperately want to capture it , but no , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder pen and paper , and he desperately want to capture it , but no , he didn &apos;t have a tape recorder pen and paper . 
he feels the familiar , of anxiety and get “ in his body , I was going to lose the inspiration , and this piece will not go 永世 阴魂 ” “ tortured me , I &apos;m going to lose the inspiration , and this piece will 永世 阴魂 , I don &apos;t go ” torture 
no , I &apos;m “ I don &apos;t do ”

if you really want to pick out in the world , and the right time , I come in handy , if you really want to pick out in the world , and the right time and again , in my convenience . 
or , you can today , to find somebody to harassed 莱昂纳德 / 科恩 to 
or , you can today , to find somebody to harassed 莱昂纳德 / 科恩 to 
since that happened , Tom &apos;s change the creative process . 
it &apos;s not work , he still is completely dark . 
but when he worn away from their creative genius , with the process of anxiety , but also transform creative genius , when he put ourselves to pull from , with the process of anxiety are going to transform the inspiration is that , just in pain , and it was liberated 倒像 原处 , put it back , and he realized he doesn &apos;t have to be in the inspiration , tortures itself . 
he can inspiration , and this is the unknown , between the weird and wonderful inspiration strange relationship , and it can is his between the unknown weird , wonderful and strange relationship -- that &apos;s a itself . 
this story pernicious I work to change the way , this transformation has saved me this story pernicious I work to change the way , this transformation has saved me again . 
that &apos;s the beauty in love , and pray , when I was a anxiety 无底洞 of despair , that &apos;s the beauty in love , and pray , when I was a 无底洞 that anxiety of despair , but not despair to 低潮 inspiration state and work , and you think this will be a total failure to be the worst of the book . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I started to think I should give up wrote this book . 
not bad , and it &apos;s completely shit , I started to think I should give up wrote this book . 
and I remembered , for God shouting and Tom , and then I tried to try and I remembered , for God shouting and Tom , and then I tried to . 
I looked up from the manuscript , to an empty room in the corner from manuscript I looked up to one of the room . 
and then you “ out loud , that this guy , I listen to ” “ 咱 both know , if this book , it &apos;s not a person is not my fault , isn &apos;t it ? ” “ 咱 both know , if this book , it &apos;s not my fault , not one ” is ? 
“ because you can see , I &apos;ve put all of them kept ” “ because you can see , I &apos;ve put all of the ” nothing . 
“ if you want this book is better , and now you turn to them , do you ” of work . 
if you don &apos;t “ to help you , it &apos;s seen ” ghost to . 
&quot; I &apos;m going to continue to write down , because this is my job . &quot; 
I hope that the historical record , I hold 尽责 jobs , and perhaps today , I hope that the historical record : I 尽责 to hold my jobs . 
I hope that the historical record , I hold 尽责 jobs to me , because this is because the last few centuries ago in the North Africa in the desert , people will 月色 the party of the sacred we had a few centuries ago in the North Africa in the desert , we had 月色 the party of the sacred until the last several hours . 
the performance , wonderful , because they are a great dancer and the professional performing a wonderful , because they &apos;re a professional dancer . 
occasionally , though , but very few indeed something happens to be a dancer , was when 出世 beyond 
you know , I should say this , because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
time to stop , as a dancer across time to stop , across the dancer like and what he did not 1000场 performance of what was different , but all of a unified up . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human , light from the inside of his life , from the bottom . 
&quot; no , he &apos;s a normal human life , from the inside , the light from the bottom of the light and shine by sacred fire . 
the people , to know what it is , they can , it was called the name of the people , to know what it is , they can call it . 
they would take up to do : hands , Alabama , Alabama , Alabama , God , God , God , they would take up to do : hands , Alabama , Alabama , Alabama , God , God , God 
everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
interesting 野史 Moore &apos;s Law empire is , when the southern Spain , and they brought this practice interesting 野史 Moore &apos;s Law empire is , when the southern Spain , and they brought this tradition , and a few centuries 颂词 , and the change from Alabama “ ” , Alabama , you know , you become “ 嘞 嘞 ” and a few centuries , and to change the 颂词 “ , Alabama , from Alabama “ 嘞 ” into you , you know , you can still 嘞 ” 斗牛 today in the game and 弗拉明 戈 喝彩声 hear it . 
in Spain , when a performer done some incredible amazing people will give you all are cheering you on your way : “ Alabama 嘞 嘞 , you know , you know , really , really great , great , that &apos;s incredible miracles ” phenotype . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn to wake up , the artist is in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 awake at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning that is , he &apos;s not the miracles 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , the older people are going to go to heaven , maybe , and he couldn &apos;t get the last night that . 
maybe he never somebody dance in all are cheering you on your way to show how he miracles from ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most of my self cognitive one . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is my self in one of the most painful cognitive , this is a very tricky issues , which is the most of my self cognitive one . 
but maybe we should , so that if you were never thought of art , and that is starting from you , if you were never thought of art , and that is starting from you . 
if you think they &apos;re kind of magic , it &apos;s just a loan , you just give you 精美绝伦 work if you think they &apos;re kind of magic , it &apos;s just a loan , you just give you 精美绝伦 work in your work to do , to other people . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
in the past few months , I started looking at it this way , a problem in the past few months , I started looking at it this way . and in my writing a book that dangerous , people who have , of selling , after I work 大作 after that dangerous , people who have , of selling , after I 大作 later . 
and I need to do , is keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : and I need to do , is keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : “ . don &apos;t fear , don &apos;t you just need to do good ” that part of the work . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , do you ” that part of the work . 
third way raga “ , don &apos;t fear , do you ” that part of the work . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : if you are , it &apos;s dancing . 
hold in your , whatever you jobs is : if you are , it &apos;s dancing . 
if you , that was the sacred evil 精灵 decided to make miracles through with you , even if that &apos;s just a 瞬 belong to you , but the sacred and evil 精灵 decided to make miracles through with you , even if it &apos;s just a 瞬 so , let &apos;s 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
if you didn &apos;t , that you keep dancing , hold jobs for you , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
if you didn &apos;t , that you keep dancing , hold jobs for you , I still 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
and I believe that we have to teach this idea . 
if you fall in love with projects , hold jobs , that &apos;s worth 嘞 ! you all are cheering you on your way : if you fall in love with projects , hold jobs , that &apos;s worth 嘞 ! you all are cheering you on your way : if you fall in love with projects , hold jobs , that &apos;s worth 嘞 : you all are cheering you on your way . 
thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you 嘞 ! 
from Al Gore here at TED , a new situation , the global climate scientists think more than a trend to worry about that , and he ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I show you two demos of the polar ice cap 三百万年 area in the past the equivalent of South America by 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but these are not entirely of this problem , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the heart of the climate system . 
the heart , in the summer actually hyperextending . 
I &apos;m going to show you is a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s a year in the dark blue , and this is a form of the Year in the summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing “ permanent ” form , is five or more of ice , you see , it &apos;s like to blood 各部 a body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of carbon by was freezing . and of 干冰 defrost clean , methane , carbon microbes . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions in the atmosphere , it &apos;s going to have all the global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in the lake has can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the professor alaska katey walter 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s OK , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a melting of the year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising and here it is the mouth of the Nung 
there are dramatic rise in traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level is accelerating the melting . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world -- to get from the other half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice drinking water . 
and in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent less every year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
in the world to the fire and dry population decline . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of remarkable speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of 七十五年 four times more early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we increase the ocean every day 七千万吨 CO2 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India was on the continent and dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , except the burning of oil is 20 percent fuel . 
oil is very important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution is to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what the and have some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
coal oil industry , and carbon and spent the last year to promote 两千五百万美元 clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
that &apos;s what I think . 
before Christmas , my home in Tennessee dig muck billions of coal . 
you see in the news . 
here , the second largest put water up . 
and this happens to the Christmas 
this is a coal advertising carbon . 
and the coal cool is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see plenty more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
and the coal cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here &apos;s virginia west , where a lot of coal . 
the most is the head of the coal mining massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy company in the president of energy , and by a company in the legal environment , and the whole debate in the process of mining they didn &apos;t take the core of 污 . Al , and now 议长 nancy pelosi congressman , Harry Reid and energy and business committee chairman congressman . and the two people to push through all of a composite of the energy bill with climate , these guys don &apos;t know they &apos;re talking about ? 
so Al Gore coalition and climate protection is one of the current people , and we launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of coal mining and version of the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean smell better . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard a lot about it . 
so , let &apos;s look at art clean coal , like the factory . 
some 喧哗 machine spectacular ! 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal is global warming in one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
look at it . this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
the U.S. economy is a crisis , national security , climate crisis 
all these crisis strings together is based on carbon , like the dirty oil on the imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
america repower with 100 percent in 10 years of clean electricity . 
the new work life , we get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
to understand more repower america . 
one last 
it &apos;s about repower america . 
in the old oil and dirty murder of our planet is to reduce that we rely on the other way . 
in here . the wind , solar energy , new network . 
investment to create a new kind of work . 
has repower america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much .

first of all , I want you to think about as you play in the building blocks . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , and you &apos;re learning how to solve problems . this is to understand and 空间结构 objects . 
understand 空间结构 objects around very helps us to learn a lot of things . 
so , as a computer scientist , in this field hand-powered inspired by the way , and in my mentors pattie and my partner kalanithi , affordable , and I started thinking about -- is that we can use a new computer mouse cursor to move , it &apos;s better than a digital fingertips in desktop -- that would move ? that &apos;s how we can use to direct hand , we sensory information to a combination of information -- that would ? 
and so the question of sitting in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable each other , sense each other , and move 每块 siftable monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that this digital information tools . 
this individual tools , more and more sensitive to each other , sensory perception of any subtle , so we can use this interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
it &apos;s like this siftable reflection , if I put it to one side , so it &apos;s shown in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if I put out a 挨 , a really interesting phenomenon is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , they &apos;ll also aware , that would have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other , and the perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like that , like the color down from a liquid into another siftable siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s three paint patterns in the bucket siftables , we can put into the barrel of color in the middle of the color , which together . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic -- is that language , and through these functions -- we want to learn , to see on-the-spot faster . 
this is I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- it &apos;s a simple equation , I made of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this together in a game , you just take a piece of a letter siftable dollars , and when you put a letter of siftables together words in the dictionary , the siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later automatically siftables spell on the right word that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , some of the screen is in the Media Lab children are involved in the test siftables children experience , I took the experience . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and the interesting thing is playing games together words that we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables in some other people experience . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , is just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is called the kids Felix . 
he can add elements to put some new graphics , what he did was to pick up to the table siftables towards a graphics , you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he added up the sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now he put it in . 
in orange . 
do good . 
in the siftables graphics can bring forth a new elements to this add up his new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing a story of his animation . 
hello ! 
this is an open , in the end of the story of how he plan story . 
sitting in the fly away . 
and I &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function in , playing music is even more recently , we developed siftables function in this , to sound frequencies , and like 超载 and drum . 
every tiles , had to regulate 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules into edit siftable you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a 响器 , with the filter and siftable module . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control the overall rhythm and volume edited siftable tiles tiles siftable to adjust the rhythm and volume . 
we look at . 
to put the two tiles 超载 into edit , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 voice . 
now to put sound filter tiles Drums , so that it can adjust tiles . 
I just put up some rhythm rhythm to edit tiles module . 
now to put sound filter , a shellfish tiles tiles . 
music playing in the process , we still can . 
so don &apos;t need to play , but even in advance , based on a long time , and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end with the tiles , volume edited tiles on the left , to use this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium computer-human interaction with the better the human brain . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you in the idea is that we developed a new generation sophisticated technology -- and the digital media 接轨 technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
