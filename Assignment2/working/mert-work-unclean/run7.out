through rapture purpose photos and stories , the National Geographic explorers by Wade Davis celebrated the diversity of the world extraordinary indigenous culture , that &apos;s an alarming rate disappeared from the earth . 
by Wade Davis about endangered cultures 
for me , traveling around the world and in the anthropology of one of the most fun is not forget the experience of traditional groups of life in the wind to touch by rainwater wash 晶莹 light rock the taste of bitter lobes with it , you can feel their history . 
in the fabled 萨满教 tiger going across the context of the Inuit old people still notion that the mythology of empathy , or in following 法门 in the Himalayas Buddhist that remind us of the core of the human mind responsibility is it that we live in the world is not an absolute consciousness is just a reality , and it &apos;s a model for sexual choice , and our ancestors in many generations ago to make that choice . 
and of course , we all follow the same a flexible rule . 
we are born 生儿育女 母腹 and in the world 
we &apos;re going to experience of adult would 
we have cruel 生离死别 so we need to sing and dance 苦楚 排遣 life that we create art . 
but you &apos;ll find that every culture songs rhythm and dance has unique signature . 
whether it &apos;s in the jungle Krishna is 伯南人 voodoo in Haiti taught 侍僧 or Northern Kenya Julius Sue 武士 安迪斯 mountains , desert 巫医 or the Sahara desert account around the middle of a hotel with the people I used to the desert , he &apos;s a 结伴 牦牛 牧养人 live in the top of the world Everest hill . 
all these groups show us a different way of living and different ways of thinking and different now . 
if you think you can now send this thinking will let you see hope . 
the world of cultural 五彩缤纷 犹如 by mental life and culture , a life of the cover the entire planet it had a very important 芸芸众生 of the Earth as we call the meaning of the biosphere as important as the net . 
you can put this culture of life , the web as a race on for this race can be defined as a human since has been created by imagination that all the ideas and dreams , all of the 之和 myths and intuition . 
this is great for the human race . 
it &apos;s a symbol of our identity , and we as a very strong at the species . 
as the biosphere of race and the same with the same , the destruction of the end , and it faster . 
no one can say a 50 percent or more species extinct , or at the brink of extinction . because the truth of the most pessimistic biodiversity and the cultural diversity than the most optimistic . 
this one of the most important is that language . 
we live on this planet have been 6 : 00 language 
language is not just sounds and grammatical rule . 
language is the human spirit flash 
it &apos;s actually in the spirit of the unique culture in the material world 承 therapy . 
each one is a language that an ecosystem with a long-term precipitation and accumulate 
we know the Earth , 6 : 00 language that number , and we all these different languages in half no longer to teach kids . 
these language has no 传人 that do work unless they &apos;re going to be disappeared completely . 
imagine that when you 有口难言 or , you would be the last 本族语 people can &apos;t tell ancestors , and perhaps the wisdom of predicting the future of children , this is how lonely and scary . 
and in fact , is a terrible about every two weeks on the planet will be with a 仙逝 with language is a very old . 
I know you people will say that wouldn &apos;t it be better ? if you only have a language that &apos;s not better ? so I want to say that this is the language of the Yoruba or 粤语 
or 科基语 
you &apos;ll find that you don &apos;t say their native language . 
so today I want to do is take you to explore the race about race loop loop , you have overall , and let you personally feel are lose civilization . 
there &apos;s a lot of people in front of you forgot , I said “ different way of living ” I said “ ” different way of living . 
for example , this kid lived in 亚玛逊 Northwest Bala Caesar pull 蚺 . they &apos;re called that because they believe in a race of the time that they 米尔克 coming from the of the sacred about snakes . 
the groups of people can &apos;t tell the difference between the blue and green is because of their 栖身 天穹 with it , so they &apos;re not the forest canopy . 
they said , a strange language and follow the rules that a unique 通婚 called went to a 通婚 异族 with the people who got married a different language . 
this is based on through the history of the mythology and you can see a strange phenomenon , because of the wedding 异族 often have a very 六七种 language , you never see 操练 a language . 
they just have to listen to say a language . 
I was exposed to the Northeast Ecuador 华拉尼 genocide is the most amazing people , one of the genocide in 1958 , I used to that they had to peace . 
five years to missionary 1957 to them , but these people made a fatal mistake . 
they dropped from the air , they have eight to 十张 . we think this is kind of , but they didn &apos;t think these people who live in water regulation by rainforests two-dimensional had never seen . 
they pick up from the forest on these pictures and images to just flip through these people trying to find the person , but they found nothing and they think this is a call to Devil . and they use it with five missionary 戮 die . 
that &apos;s not more horrifying 华拉尼 external 戮 die . 
they &apos;re killing each other 
54 percent of the population is 戮 by their own people . 
we found only to investigate 宗谱 一个八代 两例 刨根问底 natural death , and they said , the truth , and the old people . it &apos;s going to wood , they will die and 送终 戮 for him . 
the other hand , they have the 惊诧 revealed . 
they can smell unsporting characters 40 steps 开外 animals smell urine and know what it is the animals , urine . 
in the early &apos; 80s , I used to take a fantastic job at Harvard University professor , I asked if I &apos;m interested in Haiti , to go to a secret club that &apos;s the president in Haiti , and he 杜华利 support the base of the regime professor , I went to make it a 僵尸 poison . 
in order to understand the secret I have to figure out this amazing religion voodoo taught how voodoo teaching is not a dark and the . 
instead , it &apos;s a complicated 形而上学 worldview . 
it &apos;s very interesting . 
if I want you to list some important religion in the world will give you some examples . 
Christianity , Islam and Buddhism , there &apos;s some other religions . 
there &apos;s a continent still forgotten a lot of people think that sub-Saharan Africa , no religion that is not right in the era of famine , these nomadic people around the world of religion to teach voodoo there , and that &apos;s the essence of religion . 
voodoo unique about it was born with the connection between 
in living soul . 
the dance 大水 can tap a rhythm to just replace the soul of the living soul in that short for 侍僧成 shining moment . 
so , voodoo who like to say , you go to church worship to call God . 
we know to be in the gods . 
you &apos;ve been with God . what &apos;s going to hurt ? 
so you can see some amazing phenomenon voodoo teach 侍僧 into a evident trance state of de-animation the branches of a sudden , but worse for wear when they enter the state of hyperactivity extreme , you &apos;ll see more amazing phenomenon make you feel resilience . 
all of my life in Colombia groups in the north of the mountains of 玛尔塔 科基人 is the most remarkable . 
the race is ancient tyranny civilization they were once conquered and in the Caribbean Columbia coast in plain since the Caribbean , and they go back to the coast of a isolated in plain . 
in this bloody ethnic globe continent that has never been to the people . 
and today they along with monk 续 would rule , but they &apos;re very unique 训诫 monks . 
and when there &apos;s only three little 侍僧 that are gone away from their families in the dark in the bottom of the stones into the house for two 十八年 to nine years of age , and it &apos;s a metaphor for the 40,000 fetuses in utero during 怀胎 in September . 
they like to go back to 母腹 groups are taught the values that maintain the is these values -- with the universe , we can call it the relationship between the balance . 
until they age of this amazing when they first came out of his house to see the sun in the ground present mind-blowingly spectacular beauty that moment , and their families before that all the abstract knowledge is in an amazing honor rabbi . and the way to see me . I used to teach you is true . 
here &apos;s how beautiful you to protect it . 
they call themselves for lies for over , we say we are destroying the world . 
this is very important to learn . 
people say to the original 风土人情 土族 , and we will think about that Russell noble 野人 old legends that an ideal racist Thoreau we think about these people , more than we close . 
it will not 多愁善感 Aboriginal people would not suffer the 思乡 torture 
in malaria , the prevailing 阿斯玛 of Tibet 刺骨 wetlands in the wind , and how much land on this kind of rough terrain , but they are just in the power of creating passed on the miracles , it &apos;s not because they consciously recognize this intuition , and with very sensitive , they think of the world , because of human nature that can absorb . 
so what does that mean ? 
we can , for a living in the Andes children teach young adults , and he said , there is a mountain 阿普神 . it &apos;s going to use them . they are completely different category them with the environment and 生养 of a different relationship , and in Montana , one of them is just a bunch of rock can use to open 采石 mine . 
whatever it is a mountain shelter , or just a bunch of 矿石 that are not important . 
this is really important for the relationship between the people with nature . 
I grew up in the British Columbia , by the local people thought , I think is going to be the deforestation . 
this idea , a tribe , and one of my friends , has to be two groups of people because they believe that these trees are the eyes of heaven 胡克神 and eat the avatar 精灵 in the world of the most north in Hama the they have a bar mitzvah with these 精灵 which 
if you from this perspective , you &apos;ll find that these cultures create a different way of life , you &apos;ll understand them different way of life 
this picture last year , I was in August Northwest on Amazon . 
this is 阿亚胡 斯卡藤 俗称 die on many of you have heard of it is a very potent mental anesthesia plants 萨满教 徒 often it died on water -- psychedelic drugs . 
dead on the water and the wonderful thing is that it &apos;s not magic medicinal sex and is that it &apos;s processed by actually two of the matter is the one hand , it &apos;s a 藤本植物 β -- 咔 啉 蓬 phantom 硷 and small amounts of it is then when you sit down on the cane , and you can see a blue smoke it with a wooden 九节 for coffee promiscuous , that &apos;s all in the bush . 
this is a potent dopamine in the color of the brain serotonin , very close to then when you sit down . 
Jamie 亚诺马 from the people with serotonin , plants extract the nose and continuing . 
if you take a powder in these hallucinations , you &apos;ll see these wacky , in a very exciting . 
reality in front of you , it &apos;s not distorted 荡然无存 
in fact , I was with my mentors Richard Evan shultes arguing about the 1930s , my mentor , in Mexico to find a magic mushrooms are very strong psychedelic . I used to argue , and he said , you can &apos;t take these color dopamine belong psychedelic category then when you sit down , because when they &apos;re working on you play , you can &apos;t experience psychedelic . 
but these color dopamine oral doesn &apos;t matter , because they &apos;re going to be human organs , for a single 氧化酶 enzyme activity of dopamine . 
to oral these color dopamine matter have to change and oral 氧化酶 of dopamine in the other chemicals . 
this is interesting in 藤本植物 咔 啉 β -- there was going to be able to control and play color dopamine agonists 氧化酶 clearly everyone must ask yourself , so you 
this is in the &apos; 80s : 00 species out there , and how people are not in the form of the plants , linked together to play this amazing power of this as a biological experiments in the chemical effect than all working in 之和 . 
ordinary people to do all kinds of experiments to measure it wrong . 
but if you ask Indians said they would say that the plants . 
what does that mean ? 
科凡 tribe of people find the cane is that they all die in the deep jungle that we think they &apos;re different species . 
if you ask them to these plants hierarchy is how they say , I want you to have some plants . 
you have some plants , and I said , is not understand . 
and I tell you , if they said in the months circle of the plant and every one of the different plants , with the singing to you . 
that would not let you get a Ph.D. in Harvard University , but it &apos;s more than accounting spreadsheets . 
now we have a question we compassion in some people think they with indigenous life 离群索居 enrich the world forward , but as we develop these people in the back to the edge of history . 
in the 20th century , and the next 30 years later , people will remember this time of the war , or it &apos;s technological innovation , and we will remember this era of positive , on the planet to the ecological and cultural diversity of mass destruction , or passively accept this situation , where still didn &apos;t change now . 
and all cultures have been inspired by the new way of life . 
this is not technology itself . 
called the Sioux Indians , even though it still is the Great Sioux Nation with Indians and the horse and carriage courtesy of life is still in the United States . 
the threat race intact is not change or technological innovation , but he &apos;s the power of idealism . 
look at the world around us , you don &apos;t have a culture is destined to extinction of the energy that the rich people the power of rape them out of 生养 they feel uncomfortable for them , whether it &apos;s 伯南 heartland ceaseless energy deforestation and forest Southeast Asia , we pull the 游民 tribes and free and roam and pick up for them to live in the woods and has now for 沦落 仆役 and prostitutes . you can see in the water soil heavy 罗族 seems to half the 南中国海 冲走 to live in Japan , people will have to go to cargo ship from the forest and cut down the circle of wood and Jamie 亚诺马 tribe , because there were people gold . 
we look at in Tibet recently , where I do a lot of research , where you can see the political authoritarian brutal . 
although genocide in the world , but by the same race , culture , extinction denounce , which is the destruction of the way of life crimes are no denunciations , in many places it even as part of the strategy by praise . 
if you go to where you can feel the pain of Tibet with 
and I was a young colleagues from China Northwest 成都市 go after six : 00 miles southeast of Tibet journey through to when I arrived in during during the time to really understand what you &apos;ve heard about the statistics of hidden during the Cultural Revolution 6 : 00 in the temple by the largest 120 million people were killed backbone Communist Party . 
this young man 皈依 班禅 喇嘛 father . 
Chinese invasion immediately after he was killed . 
his uncle and other displacement together to Nepal . 
his mother , and then when you sit down , because 富农 family is locked up right here . 
he was only two , and he put his mother quietly in skirts and bring him into jail because she couldn &apos;t leave her son . 
his sister , because the behavior , and just by 学习班 
one day she has to be with Mau on the president of the 臂章 and being in the country for seven years of 劳教 . 
the pain of Tibet and redemption to withstand human need to get to see . 
and we &apos;re going to have a choice , we want to live in a single world still need a 五彩缤纷 , diversity , the world . 
the great anthropologist Margaret mead before she had said in the most worried about is because we &apos;ve come into this kind of their native worldview , we only see the human imagination into more 陕 隘 thinking community , and one day we waking up to forget this world there are other possibilities . 
back in the world , we &apos;ve got 60 drained there and make us feel guilty . 
human time 新石器 into an agricultural revolution , we would like to seed Beijerinck 腊 萨满 poetry is the rabbi . we create a level of all of this 社会分工 10 : 00 years ago . 
modern industrial society only nearly 三百年 history . 
I think this brief history was enough to have the ability to solve the future for millennia , we &apos;re facing challenges . 
and when we different cultures of the world for the meaning of life , you &apos;ll hear 10 : 00 different answer . 
in songs , we &apos;re going to rediscover as human beings , we have another possibility , a completely fully know the species that we have to make sure that all the race , and all of life 昌盛 prosperity . 
I was in this picture was taken in the northern part of the mountain 巴芬岛 when I and some of the Inuit , to catch narwhals 奥拉雅 of this to me about a legacy of his grandfather . 
in the &apos; 50s last century , the government is not always to treat the Inuit , to build our sovereign , we &apos;re going to -- they away . 
this man refused to move my grandfather . 
his family fear of his security he took all weapons and tools . 
you know , the Inuit , they always cold , and this is the advantage of God , thick . 
they sled of the first slide in North America caribou 鹿皮 package of the fish was freezing . 
this man grandfather don &apos;t fear the night and 凛冽 storm . 
he slept on the outside in his skin his shit seal 长裤 to hand until shit faster stiffen , he put it into blades shape . 
and in this shit blades on the edge of the spitting 口水 frozen after it becomes very robust after he knife &apos;ve dealt with this dog . 
the dog peel skin 挽具 he made a chest made out of dog sleds condoms to another was a dog . don &apos;t put that in a knife shit on the ice . 
this is really build 空手 life . 
in many ways this is the Inuit , all the Aboriginal people in the world of the life 顽强 becomes real . 
1999 four months of government to Canada , than the size of Texas and California &apos;s 之和 returned back to the land of the Inuit people . 
I was our new home , it &apos;s the name of the dimensions , New Le 
this is a independent of where they control all of the ocean . 
this is a very good example of a country can do with it , to repair the relationship between people . 
and finally , I think that ever some remote areas in the world people actually not remote . 
because there &apos;s a species as home . 
they represent the human imagination dates back to the origin of the earliest period for all of these kids and our kids to the world is part of the future . 
so we &apos;re going through the National Geographic and TV can do is we don &apos;t believe that politicians . 
we think and argue is not to convince other people , but we think about the fact that you can get to the world , so we could change the world &apos;s best at about the fact of the month we click thousands of three to five million 
we 156 channels of television show in a country . 
we have millions of people magazine . 
we &apos;re going to do is through a series of race to the journey of our audience to see a culture of what they &apos;re going to see everything they can &apos;t help but feel powerful , and we hope he pollen more inclusive and to bring these cultural anthropology , is that the core of the world need variety of ways we can actually live in a multicultural world all the wisdom of all species , to make it of human well-being . 
thank you . 
the Y aguera blaise arcas photosynth demo of this stunning , the software that could change the way we watch digital images from the . pick static photosynth created stunning photos , the dream , and can navigate . 
blaise arcas photosynth agueray . 
first of all , I &apos;m going to use the fastest speed show you some new technology of basic research . it &apos;s a year ago , Microsoft acquired our company , and we for Microsoft with this technology , it &apos;s a software seadragon . seadragon environment , you can use it to 近景 or vision to browse the vastness of visualizing the data . 
we see here is so many gigabits 千兆 bytes . level of digital photographs , and they can continue to the full , by the way to look at them , and you can rearrange them . 
no matter how all the data , images of the big and images , have seadragon of processing capability . 
so most of the picture is taken by digital camera , but this is different , it &apos;s a scan images from the Library of Congress , have 3亿个 pixels . 
and yet , it &apos;s not what the difference between the limits of performance , because the system that &apos;s just , you can use of the screen like 素数 . seadragon is also a very flexible structure . 
for example , this is a whole book , it &apos;s an image . 
this is &quot; Dickens 山庄 desolate , &quot; is a chapter three . 
I give you that this is really text , images , we can do it , you can see that this is really text , and it &apos;s not a picture . 
maybe it &apos;s a way to read the book . 
but I don &apos;t recommend it . 
this is a more , and this is an example of The Guardian . 
every image is a did starts . 
and the newspaper or a magazine paper version itself contains multiple proportion of the images , in reading , people will get better reading reading experience , to enjoy . 
here we do this in a small change issues to &quot; The Guardian corner . 
we fiction a high-resolution picture of the common -- that you see the normal advertising , high resolution of extra embedded in the picture . 
if you want to see this car , you can see here . 
you can also see other version , even technology dimensions . 
in this way to avoid the area of the actual use . 
we hope that this technology can reduce unnecessary play out the window and kind of information . 
obviously , with this technology , it &apos;s obvious digital maps and one of the applications . 
so , I really don &apos;t want to spend too much time , I just want to tell you that we &apos;ve made their own . 
these are just a NASA space on the basis of geography . 
and on top of the United States with the road map . 
now , we put these , look at the other . 
in fact , this technology has online , you can go to experience . 
this project called photosynth , it actually merging two different technology . 
one is seadragon , and the other , from graduate school at the University of Washington noah snavely that the computer vision . this research , Washington University , Steve seitz . 
and Microsoft Research Rick szeliski help . this is a very beautiful cooperative . 
this project on the Internet has already applied seadragon technology , it &apos;s based on the building . 
you can see , we have a picture of the way to look at pictures , and to do at more nuanced and have resolution to experience . 
but , these images in the space is actually a very meaningful . 
computer vision algorithms to these pictures together , these images are going to be true to space , and in this space , we took these pictures -- these pictures are in Canada , pull the Rockies 西湖 and lakes grassi . nearby -- all the picture is taken in here . so you can see here is the elements was full of hope , or MRI , and that is in space . 
I &apos;m not sure whether we have time to show more full of the environment . 
there &apos;s a lot of sense of more than this space . 
so let &apos;s look at the last summer , we use noah early database of models of what the photosynth . I think it &apos;s definitely the technology we 抢眼 . it &apos;s not just like we show the website that simple . 
because we make the website , many respects Posse Comitatus restrictions legal problem . 
here is the Flickr website images of Paris Notre Dame . you &apos;re going to do just Flickr website “ Paris Notre Dame ” input , and then you can see a lot of pictures , including the photograph alleys , etc . , all these orange color represents a cone to build models . 
these are all the images from Flickr , by this by 串联 in space . 
and then , we can so easily of views . 
and in fact , I never thought I would last for Microsoft . 
by this pretty amazing , really happy . 
I think you can see that these images from a lot of different the camera phone camera , from a single to the . so a lot of different quality , in all together in this environment . 
let me get some more weird . 
see , a lot of pictures of the visitors 大头 on and so on . 
I remember here -- should have a series of photos , here . 
this is Paris Notre Dame posters . 
we can get to see the poster of the environment . 
here &apos;s the point that we can work with the community . we can start to get everyone to different data of memory , collect together to build models . 
and when all of these images are intertwined , to a much more than just take all . 
this model menacing , what is the whole planet . 
and it &apos;s Stephen Lawler : tour of Virtual Earth , &quot; The long tail market . 
this kind of model , as people used to be complex , and become more valuable . 
the user , went on to you . 
if people are willing to all of these Notre Dame 圣贤 in the tags , who they are , that we have a rich Notre Dame picture , and then , we can for starting with this picture , into this space , this picture by a lot of people can build a virtual world , to get a across model , across the user interface . 
and of course , this is another valuable product is a very rich model -- this is interesting every corner of the landscape . the landscape , not just in the air and satellite images , but really people pressing the shutter 一刻所 collection of the collective memory . 
thank you very much . 
if I understand that right , you &apos;ll be able to this software in the next few years to the images from the 接合 together ? 
. this is actually the software is to explore . 
it &apos;s in this building up a link between . 
this is the process of 接合 based on the content . 
the more exciting is pictures of the text semantic information . 
for example , you &apos;re in the picture , a type , on the web to have a lot of with this picture . 
now , all these pictures , the image with you ? 
now , so these semantic information within each of links , and that &apos;s huge . it &apos;s going to be very typical network effect . 
blaise , it &apos;s unbelievable . congratulate you . 
thank you very much . 
psychologist in Western society to 施瓦茨 principles -- one of the center of freedom . it started in 施瓦茨 more that we have more freedom , and makes us paralyzed . they have become more joy , we bring more not satisfied . 
in 施瓦茨 : the puzzle . 
and I want to talk about this book , I hope it &apos;s part of the content , and you &apos;ve heard some of the things that empathy , if you don &apos;t know what I &apos;m here to try to help you put them together . 
I want to from a of principles . 
what kind of principles ? 
that &apos;s the Western industrial society , not by 笃信 a credo . 
the principles that is to say , if we allow people to get the benefits , the way is to maximize that individual liberty . 
the reason is free , and this is a wonderful , to value , for people . 
and once people have freedom , we can use to 做主 all the benefits , don &apos;t have to get people for 做主 . 
the freedom to make a way that &apos;s the selectivity of . 
the choice of the people , more and more freedom , freedom , more and more of it . 
I think , this idea , like so that when you add it into the water that we are firmly rooted in that people didn &apos;t want to ask questions about it . 
the same ideas and deep embedded in our daily lives . 
I &apos;m going to give you some examples of modern society at the progress of development , we become possible to do things . 
this is my a local supermarket . but not very big . 
I just want to say the salad ingredients . 
I have this pronouncement 175种 supermarket salad ingredients , there &apos;s the first 10 different would have specialized sign 榨 olive oil and vinegar 12 balsamic grapes 选购 , if you let that happen to be 175种 salad sauce , and you don &apos;t , you can use them hook to another a large number of your own salad spaghetti sauce . 
you see , that &apos;s supermarkets . 
and then you turn out to be a one store it to a three-dimensional stereo system -- a speaker , CDs , 磁带机 , radio , an amplifier . it &apos;s a one store three-dimensional stereo system is countless more . 
with this store , you can make the components of 650万种 closer together with the three-dimensional sound system . 
you can &apos;t accept that this is a bunch of choice . 
a industry , communication . 
when I was a kid , you &apos;re going to refer to phone service , and that is to Maya Bell , a company that . 
you don &apos;t buy , just to rent a 电话机 back . 
usually the phone , it &apos;s not going to die . 
the days are 一去不返 . 
now I almost infinite species , especially the mobile phone . shows . 
these are the future of mobile phones . 
and I &apos;d love to -- that &apos;s the same MP3 and play , a cut hair and French forming a brownish caramel 布丁 torch . 
if you haven &apos;t in your next shops seen , don &apos;t have to worry about , not how you &apos;ll see . 
the result of this thing is , people running into shops asking : you have a function of not so much ? 
you want to , the answer ? 
the answer is no “ ” . 
now , you can &apos;t buy a don &apos;t do so many things cell phones . 
again , in some other lives more than shopping for us , and the effect of the Big Bang . 
health care -- not in the United States , right now is that you go to the doctor , who tells you how to do so time . 
instead , you got to the doctor there , they would say to you : we can use treatment nail , can also use 乙 . 
and so forth , and make a solution nail risk . 
and so forth , and make a solution 乙 risk cure . you want to do ? 
and you say , “ Doctor , ” , how do I do ? 
doctors said these are very nail , again , risk , and make those 乙 and risk . 
how do you want to treat ? 
you ask doctor : “ Doctor , you &apos;re me , you choose ” that ? 
they said , but I don &apos;t “ ” is you . 
the result is what we say “ patients municipalities . ” sounds like a pretty good . it &apos;s actually decided to do the bear and responsibility , from a know how to do , I mean , 转嫁 to a treatment , and that &apos;s what doesn &apos;t require , can make decisions in the state of people , and that is the patient . 
now the recipe , all the ad is for you and I of the ordinary people . and if you think about it , it &apos;s just a little bit . and since we can &apos;t buy directly to the counter . 
why do they need to market . we do ? 
the answer is , they want to advertising , and we looked at the next morning , go to the doctor to call a doctor , on a prescription drugs in them . 
now , as we the gender of the identity of this thing into a choice . it &apos;s like to show this slide . 
now we are not gender and inherit business from parents , but by myself . 
so we can to shape their gender of identity . 
it also means every morning you woke up to you about today , you have to do a kind of women and men is the decision . 
in marriage , in the family , everybody &apos;s got married . this is the age of things , and then is 生儿育女 as quickly as possible . 
the only thing you need to choice , and who are married , and it &apos;s not what I married later , it &apos;s not what to do . 
and now , all of the things that can take to pick 挑拣 拣 . 
I teach a bunch of good smart students , but now I give them less than ever before the homework , a fifth of . 
it &apos;s not because they students than ever before . stupid , it &apos;s not because they don &apos;t so hardworking . 
now the reason is they are filled with all sorts of things , always ask yourself , what am I going to get married or not ? should I now ? 
and later and ? I was first child , and I knew business ? 
this is 脑筋 problem . 
they all need to answer these questions , whether they do not do I work , whether they in my class to take a grades . 
they should go to these problems , because it &apos;s something important question . 
now working , as Karl said earlier , we really is a blessing , technology that we can in one day , any time in a corner of the Earth -- any of this basket , except 夫 hotel . 
but , in this restaurant , where you can have a wireless online , but I don &apos;t tell you where . 
don &apos;t tell you that &apos;s the reason I want to use . 
we say , the incredible work that we have the freedom of choice of what we need to make decisions , again , again , again , now for work , and it &apos;s about . 
we went to see a kid play football 裤兜 with the mobile phone , another 裤兜 BlackBerry and with the blackberry , with the lap and laptops . 
even if they closed , we are looking at the same kids in rivals for constantly ask yourself , this is not the phone ? 
go back to this email or not ? I should write this 信稿 ? 
even if you give the answer is no child , you know , this is the experience of the game is big compromised . . 
look around , whether it &apos;s a big material , it &apos;s way of life , life is . 
we live in the world is like this . 
that means , choice is still there is nothing , but don &apos;t need choice . 
and today we live in the world like this . 
the problem is , what is a good thing or a bad thing ? 
the answer is yes . 
we all know it &apos;s good . so let me say it &apos;s the bad . 
all these people have two choices , and it &apos;s two negative impact . 
first , it &apos;s an oxymoron , which is , we choose . it &apos;s not , but inside , is paralysis . 
with so many choices to people that decision is very , very difficult . 
let me give you a very vivid example of this , this is a plan for pension investment in terms of research . 
one of my colleagues had access to invest in vanguard . vanguard is a huge helps fund companies , have about a million employees and two , 000多个 office . 
she survey found is that when the customers and their employees to provide a fund -- of every increase of 10 to reduce the number two percent . 
you want to fund , 50种 than you give people five fund 10 , down . why ? 
because facing 50种 fund to want to choose that it is even more difficult , so you can put and tomorrow . 
tomorrow , tomorrow , Tomorrow &apos;s halide , of course , you will never tomorrow . 
we know it means that when people to retire , may have only use 充饥 dog food , because they don &apos;t have enough money to draw the future , and make decisions , because it &apos;s so hard to even employer , that they are fairly impressive . it &apos;s all the symmetrical for a grant give up . 
not to this for a year , they make up the 5千元 employer symmetrical subsidies from 手边 溜掉 . employer is going to provide very obsessed with this . 
so , it &apos;s a lot of paralysis . 
it makes our world looks like this and this slide . 
when you go into 极乐世界 , you really want you to make a decision , isn &apos;t it ? 
where you don &apos;t want to choose wrong helps fund , or salad ingredients . 
thank you . it &apos;s the first negative . let &apos;s talk about the second , even though I in trying to overcome rigid and paralysis and finally made a right , we decided to make decisions and we can choose sexual 少时 more decisions . 
here &apos;s a couple of reasons . 
one is , so many salad ingredients species , if you buy a , think about , you &apos;re very easy to imagine if you pick a . okay ? this massive influx of choice , and you have to make you feel regret regret , that makes you feel you used to make a choice , happiness , even though it was a very good choice . 
the more choices , the inexplicably for some things to feel regret . this is one , is not always satisfaction of choice . 
and second , is what economists call ” “ opportunity cost . 
earlier today . Dan Gilbert about a enough is , we see a depends on the value of the things that we use to compare to the other things . 
well , when people think there &apos;s a lot of choice can , it &apos;s very easy to imagine that you give up the choices . it makes you always was chosen for you to think of the 美中不足 . 
an example of that . and if you , New York , I said , a 歉 
but this is what you should think right now . 
look at this two 口子 Hamptons . 
the rich , expensive . 
the magnificence of the beach , sunny , they have all this . 
or better than this ? this point in to “ huh , really bad , ” “ ” in August , is now . 
“ Manhattan neighbors are not home , ” 
I &apos;m going to “ is back can to stop to my door ” . 
for two weeks , and he was a idea torture , every day 念叨 lost in the good of the opportunity . 
the opportunity cost “ ” always let us not to have to make that decision , in fact , even with a remarkable . 
we have more choices to people in these options and more of these things are , the opportunity cost . 
this is an example . 
this cartoon means for problem . 
it also said the “ present ” . maybe it &apos;s going to do step . 
but , of a truth is , when you choose to do something , you just choose not to do it . 
the other thing you tend to have a lot to decrease , and you &apos;re doing things for you . 
and third , through expectations . 
it &apos;s time I went to buy a new jeans , I was so stimulated . 
I &apos;m always wearing jeans . 
in the past , jeans is that a pattern , you buy , pants appropriate , shit , and very , very uncomfortable , until you put it in time , long enough to washed so many times , to become 凑合 pants . 
so , this years old , I &apos;m going to buy the street to the new . I said , I want to feed “ a jeans , this is the size of the ” I . 
and said , you have to type , the comfort of the sweatpants , or is it ? 
in front of his buttons . it is to locked ? 石磨 or acid wash ? 
to that quickly grinds them ? 
and , to the mouth ? he 喋喋不休 to ask . 
my jaw almost off . and I got over , I said , I &apos;m going to “ that was the only ” a pattern . 
he &apos;s a wacky note , and then I spent a 钟头 all these damn jeans , and finally , to be honest , I took a I never 合身 pants out the store . 
I do not really wrong . and I had the opportunity to do better . 
but there it worse . 
why ? it , and I specifically wrote a book for my own excusing . 
I felt worse reason is , because there &apos;s so much , I can choose for a jeans , what &apos;s good to be a good and bad . 
I was very low expectations . when a jeans is so much , I didn &apos;t expect . 
when they have 100 dimensions , huh , at least one of the economy is perfect . 
and that &apos;s a really good , but it &apos;s not perfect . 
so I got I had to , and I expect to compare , and I expect more than that , I became disappointing . 
in people &apos;s lives , except together to improve people what to do a lot of good and bad people outside that many benefits . 
the result is just make people less happy , even though it &apos;s good . 
and the market , not understand this , because if they have people know , you wouldn &apos;t have the opportunity to know what this is the idea . I mean . 
it &apos;s like this : it &apos;s a belief in all the bad things are better than now . 
when one of the reason is that people could have good experience to some surprises . 
now , in these rich , industrial of civic life in the world &apos;s , of course , for every single thing you can only hope than you would expect it . 
what you can &apos;t be surprised , because what you expect me than God . 
what is the secret of happiness , is that you here today to want to know , the secret of happiness is : 知足常乐 , don &apos;t expect . 
so I want to give you a little bit of time , let &apos;s now , I married my wife , she &apos;s a very good wife . 
this thing , I didn &apos;t 凑合 , I do . 
but can 凑合 is not necessarily a bad thing . 
and finally , buy a 合身 jeans and not one of the store is , when there &apos;s only a pattern can buy , you think you don &apos;t happy , want to know why , who is responsible ? the answer was clear . the world is responsible . what do you have to do ? 
now the store , there &apos;s hundreds of jeans for you , you buy a back , not happy , and you ask , who responsibility ? 
now , obviously the answer to this question is : you . 
you can do better . 
on out there with hundreds of jeans , you have no excuse to make things happen . 
it turns out , when people make decisions , even if that decision to reach out and they &apos;re very good . to disappointed , to blame myself . 
in our past this generation , developed countries -- industrialized world and explosive growth in clinical trials , depressing . 
I believe that if the suicide explosive growth and an important , is not the only , but it &apos;s important factor is all of those disappointing . why is the standard is too high . when they have to explain these experiences what &apos;s going on , they think this is their own the wrong . 
and finally , the net effect , even though the objective is that we do better than ever before , but I don &apos;t feel like from ago . 
I remind you . 
and this creates happiness , the choice of principles , we all think that &apos;s right , it &apos;s wrong . all right . 
there &apos;s no choice no choice , but not the more choices this picture . 
here &apos;s a key , I don &apos;t know . 
but I &apos;m sure we far beyond our ’ ‘ choose the richest and the key to value . 
I said . now , here &apos;s a policy question , we should think about a policy question is , our industrial society to so many choices , is a matter . 
there &apos;s a lot of the world , at least , we heard a few of them , where it &apos;s not too much , choice . 
it &apos;s almost no . 
so I &apos;m here to talk about this topic is modern Western societies of a particular problem . 
Steve . 里维特 yesterday said indignant , the question is , we produce and the expensive to operate the car seats 于事无补 babies , just to waste money . 
and I &apos;m going to say is that these expensive , complicated choice to not just 于事无补 . 
they actually bring us . 
they &apos;re actually makes us not from ago . 
if we put this society to create these out of the system to into now people didn &apos;t have enough to the society , not only the lives of people there can be improved , we get the same quality of life . 
this is what economists call 帕累 Thomas improve . 
redistribution products to all people , not just the poor , the good life , because we got rid of those of us , like plague of extra choice . 
the end , you should look at this cartoon , and in a wise man , of “ huh , this fish , know what ? 
tell you , in the fish tank everything ” is impossible . 
no imagination , have -- I first saw this painting that it is . 
but I want to feel more clearly this fish must know something . 
because in fact , if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you get is not freedom , but paralyzed , and the fish die . 
if you want to make everything becomes possible and put the fish , you reduce the satisfaction . 
you increase the is , is the paralyzed . 
everyone needs a fish “ ” . 
and this is a fish . so , for this fish is small , and we almost certainly is too small . 
but , didn &apos;t have a fraction of the fish and that means to be suffering , maybe , disaster . 
thank you very much . 
“ from the digital world , we can create new life ? ” Craig Venter . he said , the answer is “ can ” and very quickly . he &apos;s about his recent research and commitment very soon we will have created the ability to activate a chromosome . 
Craig Venter &apos;s going to make artificial life . 
before that I &apos;ve been talking about some of these projects about the human genome and . and they found a new genome . 
we need to start a new perspective , we &apos;re doing the work of digital biology . and now we &apos;re trying to from the digital code to a new design biology , with synthetic life . 
we often trying to ask some big problems . 
what is life “ ” I think it &apos;s a lot of biologists constantly trying to understand in a different level . 
and we tried many ways , put it down to the small components . 
now we &apos;ve used it to 20 years to digital . when we &apos;re sequencing the human genome , it from the biology of September computer analysis of the digital world . 
now we &apos;re trying to ask questions , whether we can , or whether we went from the digital world , to create new life ? 
this is a map of the genetic sequence of microbes , Mycoplasma genitalium . , it &apos;s a species for the smallest genome in the lab to replicate . and we &apos;re trying to understand that if we could find a smaller genome . 
we can separate from 500组 一百组 genes that we make these . 
but when we look at it metabolism , this is actually relatively simple relative to us . trust me , it &apos;s simple . but when we look at all that we can separate , one of the genome , it &apos;s hard to believe it can create a living cells . 
so , we think the only way to continue to study these is synthetic chromosome so we can change its components to continue for the most basic questions . 
so we started to walk along this path , we can “ ? ” synthetic chromosomes . 
chemical principle actually allow us to make these , we had a big molecule ? 
and , even if we can , we could activate it ? 
a chromosome , and by the way , is just some live with the chemicals . 
we constantly digital life in the pace of exponential speed . 
we have the ability of the genetic code progress very slowly , but also in the . we recently is going to speed up to exponential curve . 
15 years ago we started this work . 
in fact , it through several . we do the first trial ago , I conducted a biological 伦理学 assessment . 
but it turns out , synthetic DNA is very difficult . 
in the world have 十几万台 make small pieces of DNA in length , 30 to 50 character , and this is a decline of the process , the fragments , that &apos;s the wrong . 
so we had to create a new way to these little fragments emissions together and put all the mistakes . 
this is our first try , from Phi X 174 phage genome and the digital information . 
is a small kill bacteria . 
we designed it genes , and it wrong , you have a 5,000 character length of DNA . 
and the most exciting is that when we don &apos;t live chemicals into the bacteria , bacteria started reading the genetic code , the virus particles . 
and then cells to release the virus particles , and return to kill the E. coli and different 兰氏 negative fungus . 
I recently with the oil industry , there &apos;s some , I think they understand this very well . 
he was laughing out loud than you . 
so we think this is actually software in a biological system , to build their own hardware . 
but we still want to expand . we want to make the entire bacterial chromosomes , a symbol of 580 , more than 10,000 genes code . and we think we should be in the size of viruses make ” “ box that they can we change these “ box ” to understand a living cell is actually part of what ? 
design is very important , and if you &apos;re in the computer started using digital information . that digital information to accurate . 
when we first to this group in 1995 , the gene sequencing for every 10,000 is basically a mistake . 
we found , in fact , on average , to sequence is 30 . if we use this sequence , the genes can never be . 
design part of the work of design is 50 character and the other than the character of pieces of the time to build smaller . we need to design , they can together . 
one of the design of the unique . 
you may have heard about in which we 水印 . 
think about genetic code has four character : a , C , G and T . 
these scripts 三联 body -- and the way these scripts about 20 amino acids , every amino acids , and there &apos;s a marker . 
so we can use the genetic code to write sentences , words . 
the beginning , what we do is use it to sign . 
some people a little bit disappointed , we don &apos;t use it to do a poem . 
and we can use these fragments enzyme . some enzymes bias cut to repair them and put them together . 
and then we started to build , far from the fragments of 70 , put them together to make 24 and character of length of time and time , getting out at the time . 
in a phase , we grow these fragments sequence , so we can give them , because we want to create a very reliable process , you &apos;ll see in a minute . 
we try to get automated level . 
it looks like a 篮球赛 对阵 map . 
when these very big piece for more than 100 , 10,000 , they basically it &apos;s hard to keep in E. coil in longer . in trying to do all sorts of modern tools of molecular biology , we turn to the other way . 
we know there &apos;s a method called kindred reprogram biology to repair the DNA , it can put together than 
here &apos;s an example of a microbial called resistant to be able to withstand radiation 球菌 三百万度 radiation . 
you can see on the top of the view , it &apos;s chromosomes in different places . 
12 to 24 hours later , it will themselves before the back together again . 
we can have that there are thousands of microbes . 
these microbes to be completely out of water . they can live in a vacuum . 
I was completely convinced that outer space , and there , there &apos;s water in a new environment . 
in fact , NASA has shown a lot of examples . 
here we have a group of this molecule microscopic images . through this process , which is what the yeast in front of the way through , and we put it into the design of the right . they talk to the yeast automatically . 
this is not the electron microscope picture ; it &apos;s just a regular optics microscope . 
this is so big a molecule that we can use a optics microscope at it . 
this is it about 六秒 image . 
this is what we open the trial . 
this is more than 580000 character of genetic code . this is by humans setting the structure and the largest molecule . 
it &apos;s over 300 million molecular weight . 
if we don &apos;t interval 10-point font to print it out . and you need to print 142页 these genetic code 
so how do we to launch a chromosome , how do we activate it ? 
obviously , with a virus , very simple , with a bacteria is much more complicated . 
we deal with this really like a biological and relatively simple , and you can take a nucleus sitting in the other cells , this is what you heard about cloned . 
for the bacteria , the chromosomes 连成 one with the cells , but recently , we also clear that we can do a whole transplant the chromosome from one cell to another cells and activate it . 
the microbes from a population that we extract chromosomes . basically , it &apos;s the difference between humans and mice . we add some new genes that we can choose those chromosomes . we use enzymes to decompose , they get rid of all the proteins , when we put it into the cells , . pretty amazing you should be like what we make very sophisticated show -- images . 
new chromosome into cells . 
in fact , we thought this just that . but we &apos;re trying to bring this process design some more . 
this is a big evolutionary mechanism . 
we all have a second chromosome from other species or chromosome , the third place in the thousands and thousands of seconds , a new features to it . 
people who were in the process of evolution and just a genetic change ignoring the realities of biology . 
there &apos;s an enzyme called limited enzymes is to digest DNA . 
the chromosome out of that cells don &apos;t and enzymes , and when we have this enzyme into a chromosome . 
it was out , and recognize the other external chromosome is , it &apos;s to digest , finally , we have a have new DNA . 
we put the gene that causes it became blue . 
in a very short period of time , all the out of all species , and completely disappeared into a new species , we put the cells on the new software “ ” . 
all the proteins are membrane , and change -- when we &apos;re reading the genetic code , it is , in fact , we will implant . 
it sounds like genes , but we alchemists turning discord by transfer of DNA , to radically change things . 
now , I &apos;m going to say it &apos;s not the century -- it &apos;s based on 3.5 billion years of evolution . 
and I think we can create a new version of the Cambrian explosion , life appeared on this digital design a new species . 
why do that ? 
I think we need to do that for some reason &apos;s very clear . 
our population in the next 40 years from 65亿 into nine billion . 
in my own case , I was born in 1946 
now in the world &apos;s three people in every single one of us from 1946 ; there in the next 40 years , become four . 
we provide the food for 65亿 , clean fresh water , medicine , all the fuel , very difficult . 
that &apos;s a nine billion people in 捉襟见肘 . 
we use over 50亿顿 300多亿桶 oil , coal . it &apos;s 10 . every day . 
when we try to think about this creature program , or any can replace it , this is a huge challenge . 
and then , of course , is that this material in the CO2 emissions in the atmosphere . 
and we found from around the world &apos;s about a database of 两千万组 genes , and I just love them as the future of design components . 
there &apos;s only 10 electrical industry , and look to components that can get diversity . 
now we come from the reality of biology and our imagination . 
now we have this technology , because these can make we call the mixing “ group of synthetic ” very quickly . 
we now have the ability to make a robot that we can make a chromosome . 
when you think of different 两千万组 processed this gene , and try to optimize the steps that 制剂 辛烷 or make drugs , and new vaccines , and we can change , even a small team , can do better than the last 20 years of science , what do more molecular work . 
and this is just the standard choice . we can survive , the ability to choose , chemical production , or the fuel vaccine production , etc . 
this is a screenshot . the thing is , we actually sit in the computer to really design species . 
we don &apos;t have to know how it looks . we know exactly what the genetic code looks like . 
we focus on ” “ 第四代 fuel . 
you see recently corn ethanol is going into a bad . 
soon we will have the second and third is sugar . into higher value , for example , the fuel 辛烷 or different types of 丁醇 . 
but we think the biology can make a huge impact and increased food , and not limit . it can use to is that if we can start using CO2 as a material of it . so we &apos;re designing a new cells development in this path . 
and we think in 18 months , we &apos;ll get first 第四代 fuel . 
the sun and carbon dioxide is a way -- 
so it -- but we found from around the world , we have a bunch of other ways . 
this is a by that , in 1996 . 
it lives in the deep , deep 1.5英里 . it &apos;s almost boiling water . 
it &apos;s going to use hydrogen , carbon dioxide , methane molecules into the energy source of it . 
if we look at the two to collect their , and then they &apos;re very easy to deal with , was introduced into fuel , to drive this process . 
so in a very short period of time , we think we can perhaps increase for &quot; what is life ? &quot; the basic problem . 
we really have replace the whole oil industry , the little good . but if you can &apos;t do that here at TED , where there ? become a major energy . 
and we also use the same instant tools made out of vaccines . 
you see this year of flu , we &apos;re always going on in time and a year , the lack of money , when the vaccine . 
I think this is through a vaccine was made to change . 
this is the future might change the situation with evolutionary tree , now , as a species have such an artifact for the bacteria , it &apos;s a biological and accelerating evolution . 
we &apos;re a far away and improve human life on the road . and our goal is to make sure that we can have a chance to live long enough time , maybe you can do this thing . thank you very much . 
in this TED 09年 estimated in the short talk , Brian Cox which shares some super Collider news . now , and in the history of the biggest scientific experiment . 
Brian Cox : what the LHC out ? 
last year at TED I introduced the LHC . 
and I said to update it back to talk about the machines running . 
it is , if you don &apos;t last year , the LHC is the history of the biggest scientific experiment &apos;s 27 kilometers in circumference . 
to reinvent the universe billionth of a second per second , the state of manufacturing and began a state . 
a very ambitious . 
this is in Geneva mechanical underground . 
we use to the Big Bang , some little 
this is my installation work on , ATLAS . the probe 44 meters wide , 22 meters in diameter . 
this is the process of building atlas . you can see a spectacular scale . 
the first time we launched last September 10日 this machine . 
this is a atlas took the picture . 
and the control room rejoiced with trembling . 
and this is the first clusters of particles around a picture of the LHC along the way we plan , as part of the LHC , with a lot of particles go 辐 in detectors . 
in other words , when we see in September 10th of this picture , we know that this machine works . this is a huge success . 
I don &apos;t know this . this is also 满堂喝彩 -- when people go to Google , see if this is an icon . 
this suggests that we work on this with the culture of science as a shock . 
but about a week later , we machine out of the main point with these 导线 导线 about -- the Golden Desert . 
these 导线 transmission , and they all 安培 current . 
now some of you might say , engineers , these wires “ impossible ” too little . 
they can do , because when they &apos;re very low temperature superconducting 导线 . 
so in minus 271摄氏度 below the temperature of the planet in the space between these 导线 can transmission of electricity . 
at the LHC 九千多个 电磁铁 in a technology 接点 put on a mistake . 
so 导线 temperature rise to it is a little bit of a sudden they conduction 安培 current by resistance 
this is . 
very shocking , because the magnet material they move it weighs about a mile constructed . 
there &apos;s about 50 magnet impaired . 
to put them unloaded , the work done . 
we give them out , it &apos;s good . 
now , back to them . 
in about three to refer to be at the LHC . 
we &apos;re going to launch it and hope in June , July data , and we find out the mission of the most basic units . 
now , obviously , so one of these accidents back about cutting-edge science and engineering debate , but it &apos;s very easy to disprove 
I think this task , but we still too difficult for the fact that the projects , which is the value of the LHC . 
and I want to 复述 戴维翰 warren , a British scientists , and I remember , as an apprentice on his own defense meaningless experiment -- he &apos;s an apprentice , Michael 法拉 -- said , for the human brain development , nothing more dangerous idea : think we have to understand science as a mystery of everything the human beings have been so 全胜 and stop to explore . 
thank you . 
for those who incredibly great social often contemporary art , thanks to the author , for people to a genius , beyond unusual . Elizabeth Gilbert for this to explore and thinking , 独到 for creating genius : that &apos;s a guy with a genius , ” “ than he or she in creativity , the genius “ ” help . this talk , vivid interesting 令人感动 personal color , and of inspiration . 
Elizabeth Gilbert 呵护 . about creativity and make them . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I &apos;m a writer , writing is not just my career , and I was obsessed with the love of life . 
I think it &apos;s never going to change things . 
however , recently , in my life &apos;s work , but nonetheless , a specific event recently in my life work a special events that happened to me , and I have to rethink the relationship between my work . 
this particular event is : I published that book , the latest 回忆录 &quot; food &quot; pray , love , and this particular event is : I published that book , the latest 回忆录 &quot; beauty , and pray , &quot; I love that very generic . no . I don &apos;t know how , in a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller , somehow , into a book was an incredibly tragic event , exciting international bestseller 
it &apos;s now , if I , people think this is my life , and the result is whether I , people think this is my life . 
really , like , completely , saved , 完了 ! 
they &apos;re very anxious , came to me and said , “ you not afraid ? not afraid that you are not beyond the book ” ? 
you don &apos;t “ . would you like this life forever and also , don &apos;t work that love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever and also , don &apos;t work that love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever and also , don &apos;t work that love ? ” “ you not afraid you &apos;re going to write this life forever , and also that don &apos;t love ” work ? 
it &apos;s going to comfort people . 
I was very difficult to date , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , I decided to become a writer , of the things that would be very difficult , fortunately , I think about 20 years ago , decided to become a writer . I was a teenager , I was being met the same question , people say , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
I was being met the same question , people say , you don &apos;t afraid will never work ? 
you don &apos;t be afraid of bearing down upon to you ? 
you don &apos;t afraid of what life is to have a ? you don &apos;t afraid of what life is to have ? you into the broken dream of going to die in despair , with the pain in your last broken dream of despair , died in the center . 
you end up in fragmented dream of despair die , and in the center of failure , and I was always get question . 
and the question , simple answer is : ” “ . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
yes , all these people get scared , until today . 
actually , except that , I &apos;m afraid not many people think that this , I &apos;m afraid that a lot of people don &apos;t know . 
for example , the grass , there are other things . 
but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? but , fear of writing , I &apos;ve been wondering , why would I fear of writing ? 
this is the idea of a rational ? 
people fear in your own destiny work ? it logical ? people afraid of doing the work of your own destiny ? this logic ? 
what &apos;s creative work , that &apos;s how we worry about mental health for each other ? creative work up there , and that &apos;s how we worry about mental health for each other up ? other industries but don &apos;t do this , right ? 
for example , my dad was a chemical engineer in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he was a chemical engineer in chemical engineering 40 years of his career , I don &apos;t remember someone asked if he was a chemical engineers . 
no one said , &quot; John , chemical “ work met bottleneck ? ” ? 
it could never ask . 
and of course , 平心而论 , chemical engineer this group , not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world , and not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism 狂躁 享誉 around the world . 
not in the last few centuries , addiction , depression , alcoholism , and the 狂躁 享誉 down , and we writer , indeed , that &apos;s not only the writers , in the field of creative people seem to have emotions , not very stable 恶名 writers , in the field of creative people seem to have very stable 恶名 . 
just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses in the case of creating 英年早逝 just look at the early in the last century , the great geniuses 英年早逝 creativity is always the case before died . 
even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent , even if the suicide , often don &apos;t show their talent 
the 曼梅 died , in the last time I said , in every book “ all 蚕食 ” part of me . 
my work for you , this is how radical statement . 
but we wanted to story , because we already 视若无睹 见怪不怪 , but we wanted to story , because we already 视若无睹 见怪不怪 and somehow , people are completely within this idea . take this idea is , creativity and pain , art and to create will be extremely 苦闷 this idea is , creativity and pain , art and to create will be extremely 苦闷 
today I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? I want to ask you , you are no dispute about that ? 
you think that no problem ? even further away from a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree that even further from the outside in a look at this point , I don &apos;t agree with the outside in 
this terrible 可憎 , and not only that , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
this terrible 可憎 , and not only that , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century 可憎 , and that &apos;s not , I don &apos;t want this idea that goes to the next century . 
I think we encouraged the great geniuses live to be more . 
and I myself , believed that is due to my in the dark , and I myself , believed that is due to my in the dark , especially in my career stage right now , especially in my career . 
you see , I was young , I get to 40 years old , you see , I was young , I only 40 years old . 
I have about the next 40 years of career 
and probably , from this moment , I write a piece of will be used to a book and I was an incredibly tragic event of to compare , isn &apos;t it ? will be used to a book and I was an incredibly tragic event of to compare , isn &apos;t it ? 
and frankly , we see in this talk , and I say , is the heart and friends , right , potentially , this is the most successful in the past . 
Oh my God , this is what the idea . 
is this idea , people on a 大清早 drinking wine -- that &apos;s the way back , is this idea , people on a 大清早 drank -- the way back . I don &apos;t want to be . 
I don &apos;t want to be that I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
I want to do what I love writing , so the question is : I should do ? 
after a deeper , in my opinion to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protect mechanisms to keep writing , and I have to create a psychological protection . 
I have to in some way , to build a safe distance from writing itself , and I work for responses from the anxiety writing itself , and my response to the anxious . 
for a year ago , I can see , in history , and find in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in history , and find in different culture , looking for a year ago , I can see , in the history of looking at different culture , to see if they have more than we better , more rational to help 艺术工作者 with the idea of what art is the emotional risk to help 艺术工作者 art with what &apos;s the emotional risk . 
this brings me to find the ancient Greek and ancient Rome . 
so please bear with me , because the last would go back to us . 
in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself in the ancient Greek and ancient Rome , people don &apos;t think creativity comes from human itself . 
people believe , creativity is a kind of sacred 精灵 from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable purpose from distant and unknowable to artists , with a remote and unknowable . 
the Greeks common to call this with creativity of for 精灵 stewards for “ ” 
and people often think Socrates there &apos;s a stewards for that gives him , from a common wisdom was that people think there &apos;s a -- Socrates stewards for that gives him , from a distance . 
the people with similar ideas , they put this kind of creative genius 精灵 called “ ” Ancient Rome people with similar ideas , they put this kind of create 精灵 called ” “ genius 
this wonderful , because people don &apos;t think Rome ” “ genius is a particularly intelligent personal this wonderful , because people don &apos;t think Rome ” “ genius is a particularly intelligent people . 
they think is a wonderful ” “ genius of the sacred , and they even think “ genius ” live in an artist &apos;s studio walls , like a little more than 精灵 “ genius even think they live in an artist ” walls of the studio , like little 精灵 than they would get quietly , invisible to help artists on work , and they will quietly 成败 drill , invisible to help artists work , and 成败 . 
this is amazing , this is what I was looking at this safe distance from work is to protect the psychological 成败 mechanism . 
we can understand it works , right ? 
by this ancient artists , and get protection of the ancient artist narcissistic by this idea , and get protection of narcissistic . 
if you work great , that can &apos;t completely attributed to you because you know , you &apos;re a glass of genius “ ” help done . 
if you work really bad , but not all of you . 
everybody knows that &apos;s because you “ genius ” very bad . 
this is the Westerners in the last for a long time about creativity . 
and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea , and then the Renaissance , everything changed , people have a great idea : “ , let &apos;s take a human heart , in the universe beyond the gods and mysterious and unknown “ ” human in the universe beyond the gods , mysterious and unknown ” and no space for the gremlin who will deliver sacred . 
this is the beginning of humanism is rational , people start to believe that human creativity that completely from rational individuals itself , and this is the beginning of humanism , people start to believe that human creativity that completely from rational individuals itself , and this is the beginning of humanism , people start to believe that it comes from human creativity , individual itself . 
the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a genius “ ” for the first time ever , people will be a genius “ ” artists called , rather than having a ” “ genius 
and I want to say , I think it &apos;s a big mistake . 
for one person , a individuals to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and with all of these things , to believe that he was take the sacred unknown , create , and the source of these things with the demand for fishes , he swallow the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
he asked for fishes swallow the sun , that individual , vulnerability is too big . 
this is a completely distorted the self , and for people to expand the achievement was this completely distorted of a people , and for people to expand the achievement . 
I think that &apos;s this pressure , in the last 500 years of get an artist , I think that &apos;s this pressure , get in the last 500 years of artists . 
if it &apos;s so at least I think this is so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
so the question is : do now ? we can change this ? 
maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to reference for human creativity and understanding ? maybe we should go back to the ancient past , to reference for human creativity , they understand ? 
maybe not . 
we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes , out of the question-asking 500多年 rational human mind , we can &apos;t use a short 18 minutes , the question-asking 500多年 out of the reason . 
and maybe in the audience today , that people can ask questions and maybe they are grounded in evidence of science in the audience today , they are grounded in evidence of science and be able to ask this question 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on this idea of water ridiculous 批驳 fairy 精灵 with artists , the access to work on the water ridiculous idea . 
maybe I can convince you that you agree with me . 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
but I want to say is , why not ? why don &apos;t think differently ? 
that &apos;s all the uncertainty of creative process , the theory of 精灵 theory , and I heard all other theories or a reasonable , but as irrational as this 精灵 theory , and I heard all other theories as good as irrational or so . 
this process , for any trying to make people believe in you had this experience will know creative process , don &apos;t always rational . 
in fact , the creative process , sometimes it &apos;s beyond common 
for example , I met the great poet bowhead silk . 斯通 bowhead silk have 九十多岁 , she &apos;s been a poet , she said to me , she teenagers in Virginia when a life of the things that she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance , and she would almost manic 田间 , and then suddenly hear and feel poem for her , from a distance . 
like a breath of on the outpouring and the next to her . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
she could feel it , because this is going to 撼动 her feet . 
and now , she can only do one thing , with her , is to really “ ” dashed across 
and she would dashed across home , this poem after all , she would dashed across her home , this poem after all the way to her , she explained to find the pen to paper , and in this through her , capture that poem , put it in the paper that she explained to find the paper and pen , in this through her , capture that poem , put it in the paper that she explained to find the paper and pen , in this through her , capture that , it &apos;s a poem written in the paper . 
sometimes she it wasn &apos;t fast enough , she crazy , and home , and that &apos;s a poem Pentium , so she would miss that poem , crazy , she didn &apos;t home , and that &apos;s a poem Pentium , so she would miss the poem and she said , it will continue to mass-produce swimming , looking for a poet ” “ down , and she said it will continue to mass-produce swimming , looking for the “ ” a poet . 
in some other time , this is called me the most amazing part : in some other time , this is the most amazing part , called me and she said , sometimes she are almost 错过 poem . 
she &apos;s running home , looking for a pen and paper that poem is going to go through her , she was through it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and that &apos;s a poem is going to go through her , she was through it doesn &apos;t grab the pen , and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail , and she would take the other hand , grab that poem tail . 
and she &apos;s the other hand , grab that poem tail , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper , get it back to the other hand , poetry 誊写 on paper 
and this will intact , poetry on paper , which is just reverse order , from the beginning , the word go by , and the word . 
just sequence is upside down , from the beginning , the word go by , and the word I heard her story , like this : it &apos;s incredible , the creative process , and I ! I heard her story , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , the creative process . 
I heard her story , like this : it &apos;s amazing , and I , of course , the creative process . it &apos;s not all of my creative process , I don &apos;t work , I &apos;m so much more like a . 
and of course , it &apos;s not all of the creative process , I &apos;m not a pipe , and I way of working more like a day , so I have to get the same time , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work the same time , I have to get up every day , and sort of clumsily get , devoted to work . 
but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get an incredible inspiration , but even as 古板 occasionally , I &apos;m going to get an accident . 
in a lot of people might have similar experience . 
you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration you want to , even 墨守成规 people like me , would have to know where inspiration . 
what &apos;s going on ? 
we &apos;re going to see how it will not rational , loss ? we &apos;re going to see how it will not rational , loss ? 
I know contemporary artists , with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 I know contemporary artists , with this problem is the best musicians 汤姆威兹 a few years ago , I was a magazine job interview he , when we talk about this problem .

it &apos;s not work , he still is completely dark .

I hope that the historical record , and I hold 尽责 jobs , perhaps today , I hope that the historical record , I 尽责 to hold my jobs . 
I hope that the historical record , I 尽责 to hold my jobs because this is because the last few centuries ago in the North Africa in the desert , people will 月色 the party of the sacred we had a couple of centuries ago in the North , people will be in the 月色 . we had the sacred until the last several hours . 
the performance , wonderful , because they are great professional dancer , the performance , wonderful , because they &apos;re a professional dancer . 
occasionally , and very few , but actually going to be a dancer something beyond the transcendent 出世 . 
you should know I say this , because you &apos;ve all seen in a moment , that . 
time to stop it , the dancers across time to stop it , the dancers through what he did and 1000场 performance before , but not all the different and amazingly , together .

everybody knows : that &apos;s miracles emerge . 
the interesting thing is , when Moore &apos;s Law 野史 invasion of southern Spain , and they brought this practice interesting 野史 Moore &apos;s Law empire is , when the southern Spain , and they brought this tradition and a few centuries , and the 颂词 , from Alabama “ ” , Alabama , you know , you become “ 嘞 嘞 ” and a few centuries , and the 颂词 “ , from Alabama , Alabama into ” “ 嘞 嘞 ” you today , you know , you can still in 斗牛 competition and 弗拉明 戈 喝彩声 heard of it . 
in Spain , when a performer done some amazing people , for the magic of all are cheering you on your way : would you “ , Alabama , 嘞 嘞 , you know , really , really great , great ” that &apos;s incredible miracles emerge . 
this is good , because that &apos;s what we need . 
for artists , the most tricky is in the morning , the dancers 悠悠 turn to wake up , the artist &apos;s in the morning , the dancers around 悠悠 wake up at 11 o &apos;clock on Tuesday morning , that is , he &apos;s no miracles phenotype . 
and it &apos;s just that was bad leg , are going to the old mortals , maybe , and he couldn &apos;t get the height of the last night . 
maybe he never somebody dance all are cheering you on your way miracles , showing how he should since ? 
this is a very tricky issues , which is the most of my self cognitive one . 
this is a very tricky issues , which is my in one of the most painful cognitive , this is a very tricky issues , which is the most of my self cognitive one . 
but maybe , we have been so painful , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you , if you were never thought , that wonderful art completely from you . 
if you think they &apos;re kind of magic , it &apos;s just a loan , you just give you 精美绝伦 work if you think they &apos;re kind of magic , it &apos;s just a loan , you just give you the 精美绝伦 in you work later , continue to other people . 
if we look at this problem , everything changed . 
in the past few months , I started looking at it this way , a problem in the past few months , I started looking at it this way . and in my writing a book that dangerous , people who have , of selling , after I 大作 after the work that was dangerous , people who have , of selling , after I 大作 later . 
and I need to do , is to keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : and I need to do , is to keep telling ourselves , especially in my depression impatience : “ , don &apos;t fear . just do you ” that part of the work .

thank you . 
thank you . thank you . 
you 嘞 ! 
Al Gore here at TED , from a new situation , the global climate scientists think more than a trend to worry about , and for that he ” “ clean coal . 
Al Gore recently warning about the climate . 
last year , I show you two demos of the polar ice cap 三百万年 in the past , the size of South America by a 48 state reducing the 40 percent . 
but these are not exactly this question of , because it doesn &apos;t mean the thickness of ice cap . 
the polar ice cap , it &apos;s like the global climate system beating heart 
in the heart , summer actually hyperextending . 
I &apos;m going to show you is a piece of the last 25 years . 
red is permanent ice was freezing . 
you see , it &apos;s into the dark blue , and this is a form of the Year in the summer ice permanent ice was freezing . 
what was freezing permanent “ ” form , is five or more of ice , you see , it &apos;s like blood to 各部 &apos;s body . 
in 25 years of the time , it from here to here . 
notice that the greenhouse effect that the permafrost 受热 around the Arctic Ocean , and there &apos;s a lot of being was freezing . 干冰 of carbon and clean microbes defrost , methane , carbon . 
now , if the greenhouse gas emissions is going to be in the atmosphere , the current total global warming pollution . 
some of the light in Alaska in Lake can see a went out of the water . 
the last winter , at the alaska katey walter professor 结队 light to a lake . 
Wow . 
she &apos;s OK , what do we do ? 
there &apos;s a reason for this , the heat of heat Greenland . 
this is a melting of the year . 
but traffic than 往年 . 
this is the southwest kangerlussuaq Greenland . 
if you want to understand how the land that ice melts , sea levels rising and here it is the mouth of the Nung 
here is a dramatic rise in traffic . 
Antarctica , the other side of the planet Earth , the ice . 
last month , scientists are in the entire continent report amount of ice . 
in the West Antarctica and found a few below sea level of the islands are accelerating melt . 
this is the first sea , and Greenland . 
in the third largest ice himalayas , at the top , you can see new lakes , and a few years ago , this is just ice 
40 percent of the world -- from the water get half of the water . 
in the Andes , this is the city of ice drinking water . 
in traffic . 
but when they disappear , we will lose water . 
in the snow , Sierra 40 percent less every year . 
for me , this is a water . 
and as you can see , is very serious . 
the world in a fire and dry to dramatically increase the numbers . 
and the world population in absolute disaster , it &apos;s kind of speed . 
in the last 30 years , are a number of 七十五年 four times more early . 
this is a completely not sustainable . 
if you look at history , you can see what happens . 
in the last five years we increase the ocean every day 七千万吨 CO2 两千五百万吨 CO2 emissions . 
look at the east to west , from the Pacific region in India was on the continent and dramatically reduce the ocean . 
the greenhouse effect of forest destruction , except for 20 percent of the oil fuel is burning . 
the oil is very important , the most urgent coal . 
America is to become the largest country emissions , one of the two together , and China . 
the solution was to build a more carbon planet coal . 
but we &apos;ve started to see the change . 
here &apos;s what &apos;s the and some of the new green alternative solutions . 
so it in our country , but there &apos;s a political war . 
and the coal carbon and oil industry in the last year spent 两千五百万美元 to promote clean coal , this is a contradiction . 
the image reminded me of ? 
before Christmas , in my hometown of Tennessee out of coal muck billions of dollars . 
you see in the news . 
here , the second largest put water up . 
and this happens to the Christmas 
there &apos;s a kind of coal carbon industry . 
and the coal cool is happy and happiness . 
in the United States , you can see plenty more productive , and he also help us economic development . 
and the coal cool every day to become more clean 
he cute sanctuary workers , to bring jobs . 
here is west virginia , where a lot of coal . 
the most is the head of the coal mining massey 
let me clarify . and this man is Maasai energy company . and , in the company of energy is in the law and the environment , a controversial issue , mainly in the process of mining didn &apos;t take the mosquito 污 . Al core of , and now 议长 nancy pelosi congressman , Harry Reid and energy and business committee chairman congressman . and by the two people to Congress a composite of the energy bill with climate , these guys don &apos;t know they &apos;re talking about ? 
so the E.U. and climate protection is one of the current people , and we launched two projects . 
this is one of them , one part . 
in coalergy very seriously , we do to our cause climate change . 
this is why we spend a lot of money to make our initial goal of coal mining and version of the truth . 
in fact , not dirty coal . 
we think , it &apos;s clean the smell . 
so , don &apos;t have to global warming . 
let &apos;s get . 
clean coal , you &apos;ve heard about a lot of it . 
so , let &apos;s go to look like the art of clean coal factory . 
some 喧哗 machine spectacular ! 
but it &apos;s clean coal technology . 
although burn coal is global warming in one of the main reasons why you see here the amazing fascinated clean coal technology that changed everything . 
look at it . this is now clean coal technology . 
and this is a solution to the economic challenge and national security . 
in the American economy , national security , climate crisis 
all these crisis strings together is based on carbon oil products , like on the imported oil and coal . 
but now , there &apos;s a new solve these problems . 
repower america with 100 percent in 10 years of clean electricity . 
the new work that we get more safe , and not in the global warming . 
eventually , a big enough to solve our problems . 
repower america , more . 
one last 
this is about repower america . 
the old dirty oil in the murder of our planet is that we reduce on the other way . 
the future is in here . the wind , solar energy , new network . 
investment to create a new kind of work . 
has repower america . it &apos;s time . 
there &apos;s an old African proverb that if you want to go quickly , independent . 
if you want to go far , 结伴 . 
we need to do is go far , and faster . 
thank you very much . 
graduated from MIT , David 梅若 we showed siftables -- cookie , you can use my hands , and the size of the computer building blocks together . it can be advanced arithmetic , toys , playing music . it would be a new generation of the learning machine ? 
David siftables demo -- a toy to thinking . 
first of all , I want you to remember as you play in the building blocks . 
when you idea how to build with Legos hands-on and go , you &apos;re learning how to think about and solve the problem . it is to understand and 空间结构 objects . 
understand very 空间结构 objects around to help us learn a lot of things . 
so , as a computer scientist , in this field hand-powered inspired by the way , and in my mentors pattie and my partner , affordable kalanithi , I started thinking about -- is that we can use a new computer mouse to move the cursor , a digital fingertips in desktop move -- that would do ? we can use to direct sensory information hand , our ideas to combine information -- that would ? 
and so the question of sitting in my mind , so we decided to find the answer , so to have this siftables . 
simple , interactive siftable is a computer , it &apos;s like a big cookie . 
you can use my hands siftables 每块 siftable each other , sense each other , and siftable 每块 monitor and radio device . 
most importantly , 每块 siftable are independent , like , can block . 
and siftables represents a new ecosystem -- that digital information of the tools . 
this tool , more independent , more sensitive to each other senses , feel any subtle , so we can use this interesting tools to try something new . 
now , I &apos;m going to show you some simple . 
this is siftable reflection like it , if I put it to one side , so it &apos;s shown in this picture , if I put it in the opposite direction , and then images in the opposite direction . 
and these siftables can perceive . 
if they 挨 a girl , a really interesting phenomenon is going to happen . 
if they have a bunch of , and they would also be aware of , it &apos;s going to have a little bit of chaos . 
they can move each other and perception . 
we found an interesting interaction by some -- we can use to interact with gestures siftables like it , like the color , from a liquid that siftable into another siftable . 
we look at this , it &apos;s in three siftables barrels of oil paint , we can put these bucket color into the middle of the color , which together . 
if it , it can go back . 
siftables and machine learning , you can use to learn arithmetic and language , is -- we want to use these functions to learn to see , on-the-spot faster . 
this is I &apos;m here to show you why siftables -- it &apos;s a simple equation , I made of Fibonacci numbers . 
siftables can play games together words -- a scrabble and boggle remix of games . 
this together in a game , you just take a piece of a letter siftable with dollars , and when you put together siftables letters of the word , in the dictionary in siftables automated search words . 
about 30 seconds later automatically siftables spell on the right word that change the sequence of the words , right , you can try to put in other words , the new . 
thank you Thank you . 
so now , the screen some kids are in the Media Lab in the test in siftables experience , I put children experience process took off . 
the kids loved siftables . 
and interestingly , in this together . we don &apos;t need to explain to them . 
just to tell them , and this is a word ” “ together , they know how to do . 
now the screen siftables in some people experience . 
the right-hand corner , this is the age of experience . 
he just siftables of to put together . 
in his mind , it &apos;s just siftables kit . 
now the screen is a function of interactive animations . 
we want to be siftables learn language people . 
this is the child Felix . 
he can put some new elements into graphics , what he did was put on the table , towards the siftables pick up some graphics , you can put these new elements to animation . 
see , he added up the sun . 
as the sun comes up . 
David now he put it in . 
in orange . 
do good . 
in the siftables graphics can bring forth a new elements to this add up his new elements -- the dog 吠 . 
he was writing in his animation story . 
hello ! 
this is a open in the end of the story of how a plan , his story . 
sitting in the fly away . 
and I &apos;m going to show you one last show this to function in , playing music is even more recently , we developed this siftables function in sound , can make like 超载 frequencies and Bess and drum . 
every tiles , had to regulate 四档 任君 choice . 
you can put tiles siftable sound of the sound of the modules to edit siftable you like . 
just to put sound to sound editors tiles module . 
there is something like a 响器 , with the filter and siftable module . 
this kind of tiles that you can adjust to sound tiles sound . 
so , you can use to control , and the rhythm and volume edited tiles siftable tiles siftable to adjust the rhythm and volume . 
let &apos;s look at it . 
to put the two editors 超载 into modules , and some 超载 . 
now in 贝斯音 . 
now to add some 打击乐器 sound . 
now to put sound filter tiles tiles Drums , that can adjust sound . 
I just put up some rhythm rhythm to edit tiles module . 
now to turn to the tiles filter sound filter tiles . 
in the process of musical performance and can even . 
so don &apos;t need to even in advance , but in all playing based , long and short . 
and finally , I &apos;m going to end the play , with a volume edited tiles tiles , on the left to this place . 
thank you Thank you . 
as you see , I was able to develop a new medium computer-human interaction with the better the brain works . 
today , and I show you a siftable follow-up study , we are in the lab . 
I want to tell you the idea is that we developed a new generation sophisticated technology -- and digital media 接轨 technology , it &apos;s going to change the world that this innovation in our generation is going to see . 
thank you very much . 
I expect to share with you .
